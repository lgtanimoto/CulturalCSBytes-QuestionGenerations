An AI on the Internet that rates the health of a pet based on a photo rated Sunny\\'s cat Bengal as \\\\\"very overweight and unhealthy\\\\\" although Sunny knows that Bengal is of average weight and is very healthy from their last visit to the veterinarian.   Sunny finds an article on the Internet that mentions that while the pet photo health AI is accurate with dogs, it often miscalculates the weight of cats several pounds higher than actual. Which of the following should Sunny recommend to the developer of the pet photo health AI to fix their cat problem?\",\\n    \"Answer1\": \"The developer should check their calculation of volume: Volume = height * width * depth.\",\\n    \"Answer2\": \"The developer should make their UI more accessible.\",\\n    \"Answer3\": \"The developer should test and refine their AI with many more cats.\",\\n    \"Answer4\": \"The developer should refund all users with cats $10.

Testing and refining their AI with more photos of cats with the actual cat weight will improve the accuracy of the AI with cats. \"\\n}'},\n",
