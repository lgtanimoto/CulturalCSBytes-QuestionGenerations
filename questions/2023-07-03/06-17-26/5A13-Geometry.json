    "question_str": "{\n    \"Question\": \"Imagine you've been asked to draw a fractal. A fractal is a shape that can be split into parts, each of which is a reduced-scale copy of the whole. The Sierpinski Triangle is an example of such a fractal. The Sierpinski Triangle starts with an equilateral triangle. At each step, the middle of each side of each triangle is marked, and those points are connected to form four new triangles. The middle triangle is then removed, leaving three triangles. This process is repeated for the three remaining triangles, and so on. Cody started working on a recursive function in Quorum language, but there seems to be a mistake and the recursion isn't ending properly. As a computer science student, how would you fix the code to make the Sierpinski Triangle draw correctly?Here's Cody's code:procedure StartDrawing(integer n, real sideLength)if n equalsTo 0 thenDrawTriangle(sideLength)elseStartDrawing(n-1, sideLength / 2) StartDrawing(n-1, sideLength / 2) StartDrawing(n-1, sideLength / 2)endend\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Stop the recursion when n is 1 instead of 0\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Increase the sideLength by multiplying by 2 instead of dividing by 2\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Remove two StartDrawing calls in the else part\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Move drawing to the right and down before calling StartDrawing recursively\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In the given recursive algorithm, there is no change in the position at which the triangles are drawn. Consequently, all drawn triangles overlap, making it seem as though recursion doesn't end properly. To fix it, you should move the drawing position to the right and down before each recursive call.\"\n}"
