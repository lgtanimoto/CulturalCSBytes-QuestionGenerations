Arty's goal is to create a playlist where the total running time is exactly 70 minutes with as many videos as possible. Arty has written two algorithms to solve the problem: Algorithm A and Algorithm B. Which algorithm will create the playlist with more music videos?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Algorithm A\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Algorithm B\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Both will create the same number of videos\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Cannot be determined from the given information\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Algorithm A first tries to add as many 5-minute videos as possible before including 7-minute videos, thereby maximizing the total number of videos (as 5 is smaller than 7). Algorithm B, on the other hand, randomly picks a video of either 5 minutes or 7 minutes. Therefore, Algorithm A will have a higher probability of creating a playlist with more videos.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action AlgorithmA()\\n    integer total = 0\\n    while total < 70\\n        if total + 5 <= 70\\n            total = total + 5\\n        else\\n            total = total + 7\\n        end\\n    end\\nend\\n\\naction AlgorithmB()\\n    integer total = 0\\n    while total < 70\\n        if random(1,2) == 1 and total + 5 <= 70\\n            total = total + 5\\n        else total = total + 7\\n        end\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
