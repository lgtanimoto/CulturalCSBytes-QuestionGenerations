The primary aim is to ensure each musical note is played correctly, the timing is accurate, and there are no abrupt stops. Which of the following guidelines would be most effective for troubleshooting and solving the problems in Rowan's program?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Check whether the program accepts inputs, and if the volume levels are okay during performance.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Start with confirming that each note is defined correctly, then sequentially move to the timing of each note, and finally, look for any overlooked finish statements which may cause abrupt ends.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Look for any misspelt commands or invalid notes without checking the flow of music.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Rely solely on error messages during program execution to detect any issues.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Systematic troubleshooting strategy involves tracing the program from start to end, checking each issue one at a time, rather than relying solely on error messages and system outputs. It is important to cover the basics first (correctness of notes), then move onto more complex issues (timing of notes), and finally, ensure the flow of music (avoid abrupt ends).\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"Music music\\nmusic:PlayNote(440.0, 200, Music::Piano)\\nsleep(200)\\nmusic:PlayNote(466.16, 200, Music::Piano)\\nsleep(200)\\n//Incomplete composition...\"\n}"
