Therefore, the if statement will always evaluate to true, regardless of the actual disease. Harper should change line 6 to 'if disease == cropDisease' to fix the error.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"string cropDisease = \\\"rust\\\"\\nboolean infected = false\\nstring disease = \\\"rust\\\"\\nif disease = cropDisease\\n    infected = true\\nend\"\n}"
