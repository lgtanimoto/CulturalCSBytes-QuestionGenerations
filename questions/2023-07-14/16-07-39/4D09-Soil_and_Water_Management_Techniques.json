Alex wants to improve the efficiency of the recommendation algorithm by using a hash table to store genre ratings. The code snippet below shows Alex's implementation:What advantage does using a hash table provide in this movie recommendation system?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Faster lookup and retrieval of genre ratings\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"More accurate genre recommendations\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Simpler implementation of the recommendation algorithm\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Reduced memory usage for storing genre ratings\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Using a hash table allows for faster lookup and retrieval of genre ratings. Instead of searching through a large list of ratings, the hash table can instantly find the rating for a specific genre. This leads to improved efficiency in the recommendation algorithm.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"hashTable<string, integer> genreRatings = new hashTable<string, integer>()\"\n}"
