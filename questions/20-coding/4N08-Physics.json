Berry is considering options that include 2-factor authentication, limiting access to club members only, or using end-to-end encryption. Based on what you know about cybersecurity tradeoffs, which of the following statements best describes the decision Berry is trying to make?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Whether to prioritize user convenience or tight security in the club's forum.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Whether to make the forum publicly viewable or only accessible to high-ranked club members.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Whether to use basic password protection or advanced biometric authentication mechanisms in their forum.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Whether to host the forum on a cloud platform or to use a host server in the school laboratory.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Berry's choice involves balancing between strong security measures, which might make the forum less convenient for club members, and lesser security which might make the forum more prone to unauthorized access. For instance, 2-factor authentication is secure but is less convenient, while limiting access only to club members might ensure privacy but can limit inclusivity. Hence the tradeoff is primarily between user convenience and security.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"ActionSecurityAction()\\n boolean Is_User_Club_Member\\n boolean Is_Authentication_Complete\\n if Is_User_Club_Member, then:\\n     if Is_Authentication_Complete, then:\\n         Allow_Access()\\n     else:\\n         Deny_Access()\\n else:\\n     Deny_Access()\\nEnd\"\n}",
