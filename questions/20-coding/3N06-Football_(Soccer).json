They apply a basic encryption to encode the game plan 'ATTACK ON LEFT', where they replace each letter with the next letter in the alphabet. Their encoded message reads 'BUUBDL PO MFGU'. But to add an extra layer of security, they decide to reverse the entire message using a simple computer program. What will be the final output after both encryption methods have been applied?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"BUUBDL PO MFGU\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"UGFM OP LDBBUU\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"LEFT ON ATTACK\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"UFM GB UBDUB\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"First, Midfielder encoded the message with a basic encryption, so 'ATTACK ON LEFT' becomes 'BUUBDL PO MFGU'. Then they applied a second method of encryption: reversing the message. So 'BUUBDL PO MFGU' becomes 'UGFM PO LDBBUU'. This demonstrates how multiple encryption methods can be applied to secure information.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action EncryptMessage()\\n    text message = \\\"BUUBDL PO MFGU\\\"\\n    integer length = message:GetLength()\\n    text reverseMessage\\n    repeat length times as i\\n        reverseMessage = reverseMessage + message:GetCharacter(length - i)\\n    end\\n    output reverseMessage\\nend\"\n}",
