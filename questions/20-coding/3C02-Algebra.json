However, the 'Esc' button posting the current high score on social media isn't helpful for solving algebra problems, making it not a good match for Jess's algebra tutoring program.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"if IsKeyPressed('1') then\\n   numInput = 1\\nelseif IsKeyPressed('0') then\\n   numInput = 0\\nelseif IsKeyPressed('+') then\\n   nextOperation = '+'\\nelseif IsKeyPressed('Esc') then\\n   PostHighScoreToSocialMedia()\\nend\"\n}",
