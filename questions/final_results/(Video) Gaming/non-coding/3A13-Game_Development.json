Select two.\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Creating a database to store all the names of the players worldwide\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Replicating the rules of the board game into programming logic\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Making a virtual reality version of the game\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Designing the virtual game board and pieces closely resemble the physical game\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": [\"2\", \"4\"],\n    \"Explanation\": \"Turning a popular board game into a computer game involves many sub-tasks. Sub-tasks such as replicating the rules of the board game into programming logic and designing the virtual game board and pieces closely resemble the physical game are crucial parts. Creating a database to store all the names of the players worldwide and making a virtual reality version of the game, while certainly possible, are both more in line with extra features, not necessary components of the game.\"\n}"
