They've started working on a game, using an open-source codebase they found online. Further, they're incorporating ideas from a forum where game enthusiasts share game mechanics and gameplay designs. Alex wants to release a demo of their game for users to test and provide feedback. Which of the following statements best exemplifies how they should give attribution to the original creators?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex doesn't need to credit anyone. Open-source means that anyone can use the code for any purpose.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex keeps the names of those involved in the open-source code and tags the forum users who shared gameplay ideas within the game's credits.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex changes all variable and function names in the sourced code to make it their own, so there's no need for attribution.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex should contact all the forum users and ask for permission to use their ideas before crediting them in the game.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"When utilizing open-source code or incorporating ideas shared by others, it's vital to give proper attribution. This happens by preserving any existing acknowledgements within the code and acknowledging those from whom you drew inspiration. While open-source code can be freely used, reused and modified, proper crediting respects and upholds the original creator's contribution and fosters the spirit of sharing and community.\"\n}"
