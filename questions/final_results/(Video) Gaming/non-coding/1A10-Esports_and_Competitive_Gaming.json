    "question_str": "{\n    \"Question\": \"Alex is developing a program to calculate the total number of points a player receives in a competitive e-sports game. Points are based on kills, assists, and objectives achieved in-game. For every kill, a player gets 10 points, for every assist 5 points and for each objective achieved, it's 20 points. Given a list of Kills, Assists and Objectives for each game, how would Alex program this to calculate the total points for a player at the end of the game?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Assign points to Kills, Assists and objectives, multiply them by their corresponding count and add them all together\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Use a conditional statement to compare kills, assists and objectives and assign the maximum value to the total points\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Iterate over all aspects of the game in random order and assign points to each Kill, Assist, and objective\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Start with a total point of 0, subtract points based on kills, assists, and objectives, then take the absolute value as the final score\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Sequences and simple loops can be seen in how the points are calculated. For each item (kill, assist, objective), we assign a certain number of points and calculate the total by summing all of these. This is a clear sequence of steps - a primary feature of algorithms and coding. So, the best way to program this is to assign points to each Kill, Assist, and objective, multiply them by their corresponding count, and then add them all together.\"\n}"
