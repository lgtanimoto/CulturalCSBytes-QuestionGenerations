In one of their games, they want to ensure that the game state is synchronized across all players' devices. Which protocol should Alex use to transmit data in real-time between players' devices?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"FTP (File Transfer Protocol)\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"UDP (User Datagram Protocol)\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is the best choice for transmitting data in real-time across networks, such as in multiplayer online games. Unlike TCP, UDP doesn\u2019t check whether the data packets reach their destination, making it faster and more suitable for real-time communications where speed is more crucial than accuracy.\"\n}"
