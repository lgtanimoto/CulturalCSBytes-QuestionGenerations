Alex is considering a career in game programming and is particularly interested in how the game data is transferred among players. Which of the following is the best approximation of the process?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Game data details are stored in the game server and are constantly updated by the players. Each player connects directly to each other player for data transmission.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"A central server holds the game data, and updates are disseminated instantly to all players through a single unchanging pathway.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Game data is stored centrally, but instead of being directly connected, each player transmits and receives data to and from the server. Traffic flows smoothly through routers and switches along different topological pathways.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Each player holds a copy of the game data, correspondingly updates it, and the central server just mediates the data transmission among all players.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In most multiplayer online games, a game server stores the game state. Changes made by one player are sent to the server, which updates the game state and sends updated game data back to all players. Routers and switches control the flow of game data packets on the network, and the topology of the network can affect the data transmission's efficiency and reliability.\"\n}"
