    "question_str": "{\n    \"Question\": \"Alex is trying to figure out the most crucial factors determining a video game's sales for their marketing college course. Alex has data that includes factors like critic reviews, user reviews, pre-release hype, the game's genre, and the time of year it was released. They decide to use computational modeling to understand the relationship of these variables to the game's sales better. Alex needs to apply regression analysis to predict the sales. What are the dependent and independent variables that Alex will need to define for their computational model?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"The independent variables are the game sales while the dependent variables are the critic reviews, user reviews, pre-release hype, game's genre, and time of year it was released.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Both dependent and independent variables are the game's sales, critic reviews, user reviews, pre-release hype, the game's genre, and time of year it was released.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The dependent variables are the game sales while the independent variables are the critic reviews, user reviews, pre-release hype, game's genre, and time of year it was released.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"The dependent variables are the sales and user reviews, while the independent variables are the critic reviews, pre-release hype, game's genre, and time of year it was released.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In a regression analysis, dependent variables are the ones we predict or forecast, while independent variables are the ones which influence the dependent variables. Thus, the dependent variables in Alex\u2019s case will be the game sales, while the independent variables are the critic reviews, user reviews, pre-release hype, game's genre, and time of year it was released. These factors influence the game\u2019s sales.\"\n}"
