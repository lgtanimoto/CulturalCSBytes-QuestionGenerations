To ensure the animation sequence runs smoothly, how should Alex arrange each frame in their code?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Use an infinite loop that runs each frame in order.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Create a variable for the current frame and increment it after every loop, resetting to 0 after the 10th frame.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Use a conditional statement to check if a frame is the final frame, and if it is, stop the animation.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Create an array of frames and shuffle it randomly after every loop.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"By creating a variable for the current frame and incrementing it after every loop, resetting to 0 after the 10th frame, Alex can make sure the animation sequence runs smoothly and loops every second.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"integer currentFrame = 0\\naction startAnimation()\\n    while true\\n        output \\\"Running frame \\\" + currentFrame\\n        if currentFrame = 9\\n            currentFrame = 0\\n        else\\n            currentFrame = currentFrame + 1\\n        end\\n        pause(100) //this will pause the code for 100 milliseconds\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
