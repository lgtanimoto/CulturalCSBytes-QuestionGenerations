This use of print statements/logging for troubleshooting is a commonly used technique in programming.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action saveHighScore(integer score)\\n    if score > highScore\\n        highScore = score\\n    else\\n        return\\n    end\\n    File saveFile = new File(highScore.txt)\\n    saveFile:WriteInteger(highScore)\\nend\"\n}"
