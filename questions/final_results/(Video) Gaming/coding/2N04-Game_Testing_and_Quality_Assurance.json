While testing, they notice a delay in the transmission of data which results in a disjointed gameplay experience for users. Alex suspects it's a problem related to how data is partitioned and sent over the network. Based on the given code snippet, what could be causing the issue?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"The game data is not being broken down into smaller pieces for transmission.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"The game data is being sent as one large packet, causing network congestion.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The reassembly of game data at the destination is not working properly.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"The destination address for the game data is not specified correctly.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The delay in transmission could be due to the game data being sent as a large packet. In networking, larger data packets are often split into smaller pieces to make transmission more efficient and reduce the risk of data loss or corruption. If the game data is not being partitioned for transmission, it could lead to network congestion and result in a delay.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action sendDataAcrossNetwork()\\n    gameData = getGameData()\\n    networkAddress = getNetworkAddress()\\n    sendPacketToNetwork(gameData, networkAddress)\\nend\\n\\naction sendPacketToNetwork(text gameData, text networkAddress)\\n    // TODO: Break down gameData into smaller packets and send to networkAddress \\nend\\n\\naction getGameData() returns text\\n    // TODO: Gather and return game data\\nend\\n\\naction getNetworkAddress() returns text\\n    // TODO: Return destination network address \\nend\"\n}"
