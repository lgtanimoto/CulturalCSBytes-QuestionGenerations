They propose creating an accessible mode that slows down the game speed, making it easier for these friends to compete. Alex conducted a survey among 50 of their friends, 25 of whom have disabilities. The survey results showed that 24 individuals with disabilities favored Alex's idea. Among those without disabilities, 15 people found the concept interesting. Given the following code snippet that represents these stats, can you predict the outcome and implication of Alex's idea?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Most of Alex's friends didn't support the idea, making it unsuccessful.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Only friends with disabilities showed interest in the idea, which might not appeal to a broader audience.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Accessibile mode is favored by a significant number of Alex's friends both with and without disabilities, showing a positive cause-and-effect relationship.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"The outcome cannot be predicted based on the provided data.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"A total of 39 out of 50 people (24 with disabilities + 15 without) showed interest in the idea, implying that it could be well-received and beneficial for game accessibility. Regardless of disability, players appreciate the concept of accessible gaming modes.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"number with_disability = 25\\nnumber without_disability = 25\\nnumber supporting_with_disability = 24\\nnumber supporting_without_disability = 15\\nnumber total_support = supporting_with_disability + supporting_without_disability\"\n}"
