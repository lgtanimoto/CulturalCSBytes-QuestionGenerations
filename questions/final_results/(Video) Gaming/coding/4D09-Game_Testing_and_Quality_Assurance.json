Alex has been assigned to check if the code responsible for the character's health is working correctly. The code snippet below is what Alex is testing:If the health of a character in the game is represented as '101100', what does it translate to in the decimal number system?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"44\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"38\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"45\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"46\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Translate between different bit representations can allow us to understand real-world phenomena such as game character health. In binary '101100' translates to 44 in decimal.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"integer health = 0b101100\\noutput \\\"Health: \\\" + health\"\n}"
