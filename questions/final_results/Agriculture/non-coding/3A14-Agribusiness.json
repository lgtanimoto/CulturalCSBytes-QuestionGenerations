The friend is interested in diversifying the farm's crops and needs an easy way to calculate potential return on investment for each type of crop. Alex decides to write a procedure that will take the cost of seeds, the yield per seed, and the market price of the crop as parameters, and provide the potential profit. Which one of the following best represents the code Alex could write?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"action CalculateProfit(number seedCost, number yield, number marketPrice) returnstext profit = (marketPrice * yield) - seedCostend\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"action CalculateProfit(number seedCost, number yield, number marketPrice) returnsnumber profit = (marketPrice * yield) - seedCostend\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"action CalculateProfit(number seedCost, number yield, number marketPrice) returnsnumber profit = (seedCost / yield) * marketPriceend\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"action CalculateProfit(number seedCost, number yield, number marketPrice) returnsnumber profit = (seedCost * yield) / marketPriceend\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The profit for any business is calculated by subtracting the total costs from the total revenues. In this case, the total costs are the cost of the seeds and the total revenues are the market price times the yield (since that's the total produced from one seed). Therefore, Alex's function should multiply the market price by the yield, and then subtract the seed cost to find the projected profit.\"\n}"
