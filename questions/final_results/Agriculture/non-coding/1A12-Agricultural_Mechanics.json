The program will control the tractor to move from the southwest corner of the field, move northwards plowing until the north edge, then move east one row, reverse direction to the south, and continue the plowing. The process repeats until the entire field is plowed. Which of the following pseudocodes best represents the plan Melody need to implement?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"While field is not fully plowed, move the tractor to the east. When it reaches the edge, move south. If the south edge is reached, reverse direction.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"While field is not fully plowed, move the tractor north. When it reaches the edge, move east and reverse direction. Repeat until the whole field is plowed.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"While field is not fully plowed, move the tractor north. When it reaches the edge, move south and reverse direction. Repeat until the whole field is plowed.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"While field is not fully plowed, move the tractor to the west. When it reaches the edge, move north and reverse direction. Repeat until the whole field is plowed.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"As per the algorithm, the tractor should start from the southwest corner of the field and begin plowing northwards until the north edge is reached. It then shifts one row towards the east and changes direction towards south. The process continues in a zigzag pattern until the field is fully plowed, which is correctly shown in pseudocode 2.\"\n}"
