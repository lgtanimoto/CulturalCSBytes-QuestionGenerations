Alex is attempting to write a loop in their program which should automate the watering of their field based on the current rainfall data to ensure their crops always receive the right amount of water. However, their list of rainfall data isn't computing properly. Review the code snippet and identify the mistake. Integer Variable totalRainfall = 0List rainfallData = [5,3,6,8,2]For each number in rainfallData number = number + 1 totalRainfall = totalRainfall + numberEnd loopOutput \\\"Total rainfall: \\\" + totalRainfall\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"The 'For each' loop is used incorrectly. This construct should be used to access elements from the list, not to increment a number.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"The '+ 1' operation must be applied to the 'totalRainfall' variable, not the 'number' variable.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The 'rainfallData' list is incorrectly declared. It should be a list of strings, not integers.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"The 'Output' statement is outside the loop body. It should be inside the 'For each' loop.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The 'For each' loop is not being used correctly. Alex's intention is to iterate over each number in the rainfallData list and add that to the totalRainfall. However, in the given code, they are incrementing the variable 'number' itself instead of using it as the current rainfall data. The correct code should be: 'For each number in rainfallData totalRainfall = totalRainfall + number End loop'.\"\n}"
