They're trying to determine which algorithm would be the most efficient for analyzing the data. Alex has developed two algorithms: one that sorts the data in ascending order based on pH levels and another that sorts the data in descending order based on nutrient levels. Which algorithm should Alex choose for their program?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Choose the algorithm that sorts data based on pH levels if the primary goal is to identify plots with acidic soil.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Choose the algorithm that sorts data based on nutrient levels if the primary goal is to identify plots with high nutrient content.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Choose the algorithm that sorts data based on nutrient levels, as it is likely more efficient.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Combine the two algorithms into a single one that first sorts by pH levels and then further sorts by nutrient levels only for plots with similar pH values.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The choice of algorithm depends on the purpose of the soil testing program. However, pairing the two algorithms could provide a more refined analysis. Data first sorted by pH levels, then further sorted by nutrient levels for plots with similar pH could offer detailed and useful insights.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"algorithm1(phLevels): \\nSort array in ascending order\\n\\nalgorithm2(nutrientLevels): \\nSort array in descending order\"\n}"
