Alex finds an existing code snippet to detect green pixels in images using Python's OpenCV library. The function returns the percentage of green pixels present in the given image. Alex wants to use the code for detecting diseased crops, as diseased crops reflect a different color due to chlorosis. What modification should Alex make in order to use the existing program for their new purpose?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Modify the program to count the number of non-green pixels instead of green pixels.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Add a new function that counts the number of black pixels.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Change the function so it counts blue pixels.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"No modification is needed, diseased crops are also green.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"If diseased crops reflect a color different from green due to chlorosis, Alex could modify the existing program to count the number of non-green pixels. This could indicate the presence of disease.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"import cv2\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\nimg = cv2.imread('farm.jpg')\\n\\ngreen = np.uint8([[[0,255,0]]])\\nhsv_green = cv2.cvtColor(green,cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)\\n\\nlower_green = np.array([hsv_green[0][0][0]-10,100,100])\\nupper_green = np.array([hsv_green[0][0][0]+10,255,255])\\n\\ngreen_pixels = cv2.inRange(hsv_img, lower_green, upper_green)\\n\\ntotal_pixels = img.shape[0]*img.shape[1]\\n\\nprint(float(np.sum(green_pixels))/total_pixels)\"\n}"
