Based on where the soil erosion is most severe, the software should recommend a conservation method. If Erosion Level is greater than 70%, it should recommend 'Terracing', less than 70% but greater than 40% it should recommend 'Planting Trees' and less than 40% it should recommend 'Organic Matter'. What would be the most suitable way for Alex to structure their program?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Write a sequence of steps that test the erosion level and ignore the conditionals\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Create an event-driven program that reacts to the measuring process of soil erosion\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Use a loop structure that will continue assessing soil erosion indefinitely\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Use conditionals to assess the degree of soil erosion and link it with the corresponding conservation method\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The ideal way to represent this problem in a program would be through conditionals. Based on the conditions representing the degree of soil erosion, the program could decide upon and show suitable soil conservation methods.\"\n}"
