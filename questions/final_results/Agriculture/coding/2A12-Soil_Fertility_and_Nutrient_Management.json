    "question_str": "{\n    \"Question\": \"Alex is a budding farmer who is studying about soil fertility. They want to develop a program that classifies the fertility level of soil based on the amount of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium present in the soil sample. A soil is classified as 'fertile' if it has at least 15 units of Nitrogen, 10 units of Phosphorus and 5 units of Potassium. Otherwise, it is classified as 'infertile'. They have written a partial program to achieve this. Can you identify the missing code snippet that should replace TODO to correctly implement the classifications?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"if nitrogen >= 15 and phosphorus >= 10 and potassium >= 5\\n\\toutput \\\"Soil is fertile\\\"\\nelse\\n\\toutput \\\"Soil is infertile\\\"\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"if nitrogen > 15 or phosphorus > 10 or potassium > 5\\n\\toutput \\\"Soil is fertile\\\"\\nelse\\n\\toutput \\\"Soil is infertile\\\"\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"if nitrogen > 15 and phosphorus > 10 and potassium > 5\\n\\toutput \\\"Soil is fertile\\\"\\nelse\\n\\toutput \\\"Soil is infertile\\\"\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"if nitrogen >= 15 or phosphorus >= 10 or potassium >= 5\\n\\toutput \\\"Soil is fertile\\\"\\nelse\\n\\toutput \\\"Soil is infertile\\\"\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The fertility of soil is classified based on all three nutrients - Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium. It is considered 'fertile' only if it has at least 15 units of Nitrogen, 10 units of Phosphorus and 5 units of Potassium. Thus, the condition should be a logical 'and' with '>=', not '>'.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action classifySoilFertility(integer nitrogen, integer phosphorus, integer potassium)\\n\\tTODO\\nend\"\n}"
