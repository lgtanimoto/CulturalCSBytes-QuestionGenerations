Alex finds an existing program that sets the watering needs in liters per week for one plant and multiplies it by the number of plants to get the total water requirement. They want to incorporate this code into their own work, but with additional features. What modification would most benefit Alex\u2019s program?\", \n    \"Answer1\": \"Change the number of plants to a user input value\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Let the program choose the plant with the highest water requirement\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Add a condition that checks if the water requirement exceeds the weekly rainfall\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"All of the above\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Allowing the user to input the number of desired plants provides more flexibility. Having the program choose the plant requiring the most water ensures the users are aware of their water commitment. Adding the condition to check the water requirement against the weekly rainfall is necessary to promote sustainable practices.\", \n    \"code_snippet\": \"integer waterNeedPerPlant = 2\\ninteger numberOfPlants = 50\\ninteger totalWaterNeed = waterNeedPerPlant * numberOfPlants\\noutput totalWaterNeed\"\n}"
