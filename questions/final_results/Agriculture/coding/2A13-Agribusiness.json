It doesn't consider the user interface and experience, due to which his parents and siblings are having trouble using it. What should be Alex's next steps to rectify the problem?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex should discard this program and write a new one from scratch.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex should force his family to learn the program as it is.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex should consider his family's feedback, brainstorm ideas and iteratively make improvements on the user interface and user experience of the program.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex doesn't need to do anything as it's not his problem if his family can't use the program.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Considering other people's perspectives and user preferences is essential to make a program successful.
