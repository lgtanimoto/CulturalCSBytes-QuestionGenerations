It suggests possible treatment solutions too. Unfortunately, Alex's application is not identifying the diseases and pests accurately. Alex is unsure how to fix the issue. As a start, Alex decided to output the values returned from the image processing algorithm. What should Alex consider when developing a systematic troubleshooting guide to identify where the problem might be?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Check if the code is working for all possible cases of crop diseases.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Check if there is an internet connection.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Modify the image processing algorithm to return 'true' every time.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Check if the graphical user interface of the application is working.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Alex needs to identify where the bug in his software resides. By testing the program with different images which have different pest and disease symptoms, Alex can verify if the algorithm works for all possible cases. If the algorithm fails to recognize a particular type of disease or pest, this could be where the bug lies. Modifying the algorithm to return 'true' every time won't help diagnose the problem nor does checking the GUI or internet connection as the problem lies in image processing.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"boolean OnReceiveImage(Image img)\\n    DiseaseOrPestIdentifier idn = new DiseaseOrPestIdentifier()\\n    text result = idn.Identify(img)\\n    output result\\n    if result == \\\"Unknown\\\"\\n        return false\\n    else\\n        return true\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
