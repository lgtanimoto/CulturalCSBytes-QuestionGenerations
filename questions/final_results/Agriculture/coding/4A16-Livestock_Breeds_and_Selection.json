The program should be able to monitor changes in multiple variables and adapt the best breed selection based on these changes. Observe the following code snippet and explain how Alex should expand it to reach the desired goal:\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Add arrays for each livestock breed and iterate over them in the 'bestBreedSelection' action.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Add new variables for each factor monitored and create an action calculating the breed's score based on these factors.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Create a 'onVariableChange' event for every monitored factor that triggers the 'bestBreedSelection' action.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"All of the above.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"To design a program that could consider multiple variables and adapt to their changes, Alex will need to have an array or list for each breed with its corresponding data, variables that represent each factor being monitored, and an event for each of these variables that can trigger the 'bestBreedSelection' action whenever a monitored factor changes.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action Main\\n    bestBreedSelection()\\nend\\n\\naction bestBreedSelection\\n    number breedQuality = 0.0\\n    breedType bestBreed = breedType:Angus\\n    // Calculate breedQuality based on various factors\\n    output bestBreed\\nend\"\n}"
