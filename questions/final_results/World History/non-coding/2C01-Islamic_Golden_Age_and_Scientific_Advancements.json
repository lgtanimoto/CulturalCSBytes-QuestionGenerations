The astrolabe, a device used to solve problems related to time and the position of the stars, has multiple rotating parts each playing a specific role. Similarly, a computer also has many internal and external parts that function together to form a system. Which part of the computer is similar to the rotating parts of the astrolabe that use data to solve calculations?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"The Central Processing Unit (CPU)\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"The Solid-State Drive (SSD)\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The RAM (Random Access Memory)\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"The Wi-Fi Card\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The Central Processing Unit (CPU), similar to the rotating parts of the astrolabe, performs most calculations within a computer. Like how the rotating parts of the astrolabe use data to solve calculations, the CPU processes instructions to solve tasks.\"\n}"
