They decide to focus on steam power and manufacturing advancements using architectural, mechanical, and other artifact designs. Which of the following approaches should they take?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Develop separate simulation programs for each artifact, run independently each time.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Create a combined program for all artifacts, where artifacts can't be simulated separately.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Create a program for each artifact but ensure they can interact with each other in the larger simulation of the Industrial Revolution.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Create a single program that haphazardly includes all the different advancements without consideration for their relationship to each other.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The best approach would be to create separate yet interconnected programs for each artifact. This allows for individual simulations and enables a comprehensive combined simulation, mirroring the interrelatedness of advancements during the Industrial Revolution.\"\n}"
