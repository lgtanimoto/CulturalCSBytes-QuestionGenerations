Using simple commands such as `turnRight`, `moveForward`, `lookAtStar`, `calculateAngle`, `determineDirection`, which of the following pseudo-codes best describes this process?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"start\\nturnRight\\ndetermineDirection\\nlookAtStar\\ncalculateAngle\\nmoveForward\\nend\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"start\\nlookAtStar\\nturnRight\\nmoveForward\\ncalculateAngle\\ndetermineDirection\\nend\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"start\\nlookAtStar\\ncalculateAngle\\ndetermineDirection\\nmoveForward\\nend\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"start\\ndetermineDirection\\nlookAtStar\\nturnRight\\ncalculateAngle\\nmoveForward\\nend\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The explorers had to first look at a star, then calculate its angle to determine their direction using the astrolabe. Once they knew which direction they had to go, they then moved forward in that direction. The actions `turnRight` does not properly represent any part of this historical process.\"\n}"
