They have noticed that whenever a piece of technology related to music consumption (e.g., a new music streaming platform) is released, there's a correlated change in the type of music that becomes popular. As an aspiring data analyst and musician, Alex is curious about the possible codependent relationship between changes in music technology and changes in popular music genres. They decide to perform a detailed study in their CS class. As a part of their study, Alex is planning to use the Spotify Web API to fetch the data of the Top 50 songs for each year from 2010 to 2020. Using this data, Alex plans to analyze the 'genre' and 'popularity' fields to find which type of music has been popular each year. Afterwards they will compare this with timelines of music tech releases. Which of the following most likely describes the code Alex would write to present the patterns in this data?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex would write a script to analyze the dataset and would use a visual encoding scheme to represent the data. This could involve creating graphs to present the percentage of popular genres each year and marking those with release years of notable music tech.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex would use HTML to create a web page that would react to the changing trends in the music industry.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex would develop a music player to play the most popular song of each year.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex would write a script to make the most popular song of each year automatically download to all classmates' computers.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"With Alex's objective of identifying and describing patterns in data and mapping this to music tech release timelines, creating a visual representation using charts or graphs would be the best option. This would allow them to clearly see correlations between music genre popularity and technology release dates, if any exist.\"\n}"
