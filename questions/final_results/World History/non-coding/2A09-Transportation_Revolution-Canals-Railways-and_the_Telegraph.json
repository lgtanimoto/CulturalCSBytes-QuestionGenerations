Alex gathered data on the length of railway and canal networks and the number of telegraph stations in every five year period for a century. How would Alex write a program to calculate total growth for each transportation technology over the century?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"initialize integer Railways=0, Canals=0, Telegraphs=0 For each five-year period, add the data value to the respective variable Print Railways, Canals, Telegraphs\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"initialize variables Railways, Canals, Telegraphs Read data for each five-year period, if data is higher than previous data, overwrite the variable with new data Print Railways, Canals, Telegraphs\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"initialize strings Railways, Canals, Telegraphs Read data for each five-year period, concatenate data with the respective string Print Railways, Canals, Telegraphs\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"initialize a list with 100 elements for each: Railways, Canals, Telegraphs Read data for each five-year period, inputting them to the respective list at the present index Print the last elements of the Railways, Canals, Telegraphs lists\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"For this problem, we need to calculate the total growth of the railway, canal and telegraph networks over a century. We accomplish this by initializing a variable for each network at 0, and then in each five-year interval, adding the length of new construction to the respective variable. At the end of the century, we print the variables, which now represent the total growth of each network over the whole century. In this manner, we use variables to store and continuously modify data.\"\n}"
