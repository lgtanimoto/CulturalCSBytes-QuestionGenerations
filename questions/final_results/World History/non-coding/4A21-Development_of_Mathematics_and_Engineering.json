However, it seems not many students are able to use it efficiently. What can Alex do to make their programming language more usable for their peers? \",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Provide a user guidebook explaining the syntax and semantics of the language with examples.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Add features like syntax highlighting, code hinting and auto-completion in the IDE where the programming language would be used.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Organize workshops to explain how to code effectively in this new language.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"All of the above.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Making computational artifacts more usable and accessible often involves not only refining the artifact itself, but also providing useful educational materials, trainings, and user-friendly interface features.\"\n}"
