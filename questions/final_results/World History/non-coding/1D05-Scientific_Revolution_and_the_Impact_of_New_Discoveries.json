They want to create a database to organize and retrieve information about different scientists, their discoveries, and their impact on society. They decided to have the following attributes: Scientist's Name, Birth-Death, Primary Field, Key Discovery, and Impact. What is the best way for Alex to structure their database to efficiently search, retrieve, and modify data?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Creating a text document and use the 'Find and Replace' function to search for specific information.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Storing all of the information in an image, and segregate data based on different zones in the image.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Using a spreadsheet tool, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, where each row represents a scientist, and each column represents an attribute.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Writing down all of the information on index cards and manually sorting and retrieving them.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"A spreadsheet allows efficient storing, organizing, and processing of data. In this scenario, each row could represent a different scientist and each column could be used for the scientist\u2019s different attributes. This would allow Alex to easily sort the data by any attribute, search for specific information, and update data as needed.\"\n}"
