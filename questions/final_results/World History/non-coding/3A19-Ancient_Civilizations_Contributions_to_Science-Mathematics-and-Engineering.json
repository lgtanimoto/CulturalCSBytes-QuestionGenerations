This program was inspired by the discovery of the concept of Pi by the ancient Greeks. Alex's program works fine, but their classmates are finding it hard to understand what each part does. What kind of code comments should Alex add to improve their classmates' understanding?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"// This code is inspired by the achievements of ancient Greeks\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"// This is a code that calculates the area and circumference of a circle\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"// This section asks for the user's input for the radius of the circle and must be a positive number\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"// This section calculates the area using the formula Pi*radius*radius and the circumference using the formula 2*Pi*radius\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Code comments should describe what the code does, how it does it, why it does it, and any special considerations or assumptions made. Answer 4 is the best comment because it not only describes what the code does, but also how it does it - the process of computation, the input requirements, and the meaning of the output.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"import math\\nradius = input('Enter the radius of the circle: ')\\narea = math.pi * pow(radius, 2)\\ncircumference = 2 * math.pi * radius\\nprint('Area of the circle is', area)\\nprint('Circumference of the circle is', circumference)\"\n}"
