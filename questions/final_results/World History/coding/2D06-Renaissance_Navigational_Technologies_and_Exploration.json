To illustrate the relationship between the year of a navigational technology's invention and the scope of exploration resulting from that technology, Alex decides to use a graphical illustration by generating it with a code. Alex creates the following code snippet:What would Alex's graph illustrate based on the given code snippet?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"The graph shows the relationship between the year of the navigation technology's introduction and the number of exploratory voyages.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"The graph denotes the amount of explorations over the years without any link to navigational technologies.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The graph represents the number of navigational technologies invented during the Renaissance.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"The graph shows the number of exploration missions in a given year.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Alex has created a mechanism by which they graph the spread of exploration as a result of navigational technologies. As the code iterates over navigationalTech, which is likely a list of technologies with their associated years of invention and the number of explorations resulting from each invention, it plots the associated details on the graph. This suggests a relationship between the year of a technology's invention and the subsequent spread of exploration.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"list of NavigationTech navigationalTech = GetNavigationalTechList()\\nInteger index = 1\\nforeach tech in navigationalTech\\n    output tech.getName() + \\\" was introduced in \\\" + tech.getYear() + \\\" and lead to \\\" + tech.getExplorationCount() + \\\" expeditions.\\\" \\n    Plot(index, tech.getYear(), tech.getExplorationCount())\\n    index = index + 1\\nend\"\n}"
