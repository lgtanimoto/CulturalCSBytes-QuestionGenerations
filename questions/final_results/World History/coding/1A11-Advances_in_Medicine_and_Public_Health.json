They have a list of all the patients with their names and vaccination status. The goal is to shift all the unvaccinated patients to the bottom of the list with vaccinated patients at the top. Initially, Alex writes the following code block to perform the task. They will call action `DividePatients` afterwards. Select the correct sequence of patients after `DividePatients()` is called.\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Jon (Unvaccinated), Mary (Vaccinated), Tim (Unvaccinated), Sarah (Vaccinated), Kelly (Vaccinated)\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Mary (Vaccinated), Sarah (Vaccinated), Kelly (Vaccinated), Jon (Unvaccinated), Tim (Unvaccinated)\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Jon (Unvaccinated), Tim (Unvaccinated), Mary (Vaccinated), Sarah (Vaccinated), Kelly (Vaccinated)\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Mary (Vaccinated), Kelly (Vaccinated), Sarah (Vaccinated), Jon (Unvaccinated), Tim (Unvaccinated)\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Alex's code block iterates over patients backward so the last vaccinated patients will remain at the end, while unvaccinated patients are moved towards the start of the list. Then finally, it swaps the vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Thus, at the end all the vaccinated patients are at the start of the list followed by the unvaccinated patients.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action DividePatients() \\n integer i = patients:length() - 1 \\n integer j = i - 1 \\n while j >= 0 \\n if patients:j:vaccinated == false and patients:i:vaccinated == true \\n swap(patients:i, patients:j) \\n i = i - 1 \\n end \\n j = j - 1 \\n end \\n end\"\n}"
