They selected to implement this using a loop structure. The concept behind this is that every transmitted signal pulse will iterate through the loop until it reaches its destination. Alex's classmate questions the use of this implementation, believing a recursion method would have been more efficient. How should Alex justify their choice?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex can justify by explaining that recursion may have been more complicated to comprehend and would also consume more memory due to continuous stack frame creation for every function call.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex can justify by saying that they selected the loop because they were unsure of how recursion works.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex can justify by stating that the loop allows faster execution, since the program doesn't need to handle and manage many recursive function calls.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex can justify by explaining that the loop provides better readability and the signal transmitted in real life is an iterative process, hence more accurately modeled by a loop rather than recursion.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The decision between recursion and iteration involves a tradeoff between implementation, readability, and program performance. While recursion can often provide elegant solutions to certain types of problems, a loop structure can be easier to understand and debug, and may provide better performance as it does not require the overhead of repeated function calls. This is particularly true in a problem such as simulating a iterative process like signal transmission.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"integer signal = 10\\nwhile signal > 0\\n    output \\\"Signal sent\\\"\\n    signal = signal - 1\\nend\"\n}"
