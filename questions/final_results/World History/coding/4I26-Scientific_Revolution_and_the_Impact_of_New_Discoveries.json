They decide to use a binary search algorithm to quickly look through a list of scientists and their discoveries. Which of the scenarios below would NOT be an appropriate use for the binary search algorithm?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Looking through an alphabetically sorted list of inventor names to find information about 'Isaac Newton'.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Finding specific physics theories from a list ordered by year of discovery.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Looking for 'The theory of gravitation' from a list of Newton's discoveries presented in random order.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Searching an ordered list of groundbreaking scientific discoveries to find the year 'Heliocentric model of the universe' was discovered.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"A binary search algorithm is a quick way to find an item from a sorted list by halving the search space at each step. However, binary search won't work properly if the list isn't sorted. In the case of searching for 'The theory of gravitation' in a list of Newton's discoveries in random order, the list needs to be sorted first.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action BinarySearch(array scientists, text key)\\n    integer left = 1\\n    integer right = length of scientists\\n    while left <= right\\n        integer mid = (left + right) / 2\\n        if key < scientists[mid]\\n            right = mid - 1\\n        elseif key > scientists[mid]\\n            left = mid + 1\\n        else\\n            return mid\\n        end\\n    end\\n    return -1\\nend\"\n}"
