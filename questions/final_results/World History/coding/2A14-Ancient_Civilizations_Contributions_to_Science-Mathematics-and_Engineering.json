They want to bring forth the achievements of ancient Egyptians in the field of engineering and mathematics. To do this, Alex is drawing from hieroglyphics and ancient manuscripts. It's crucial to Alex that their program is both informative and respectful to the intellectual property of these ancient cultures. Given this, which of the following actions should Alex take?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Copy the hieroglyphics and manuscripts directly into the program without attribution since they are from ancient cultures which do not have modern laws.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Attribute the sources of the hieroglyphics and manuscripts in the program and acknowledge the civilization's pioneering role in the field.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Use the hieroglyphics and manuscripts directly but just in parts so it\u2019s not plagiarism.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Digitally alter the hieroglyphics and manuscripts so they are not identical to the originals.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Even though ancient civilizations do not have modern copyright laws, attributing the sources and acknowledging their pioneering role in the field respects their intellectual contributions and acts as an educational message to all about the valuation of intellectual property rights.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"output \\\"In the field of Engineering and Mathematics, ancient Egyptians developed a decimal system and used it in their construction projects. This information is drawn from various hieroglyphics and ancient manuscripts discovered over time.\\\"\\noutput \\\"This program respects the intellectual property rights of these ancient contributions and duly acknowledges the pioneering role of ancient Egyptians in these fields.\\\"\"\n}"
