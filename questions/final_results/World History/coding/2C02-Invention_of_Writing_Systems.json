They think of using a computer program to illustrate how simple symbols started representing complex ideas in ancient civilizations, thus showing how hardware and software work together. Which is the best way for Alex to do this?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"By creating a series of pixels that form characters and symbols that the program can generate when certain keys are pressed.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"By programming a simple, text-based adventure game, where the story changes based on the user's inputs.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"By developing a simple calculator program that performs basic mathematical operations.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"By creating an email system that sends and receives messages in binary format.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"By creating a program where specific keys generate certain characters and symbols, Alex is illustrating how the hardware (keyboard) and software (the program interpreting the key presses) work together to create the 'writing systems' that computers use. This is a great analogy to historical evolution of writing systems.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"class KeySymbol\\n   action KeySymbol\\n       text symbol\\n       number key \\n   end\\n\\n   action setKey(number key)\\n       this:key = key\\n   end\\n\\n   action setSymbol(text symbol)\\n       this:symbol = symbol\\n   end\\n\\n   action getSymbol() returns text\\n       return symbol\\n   end\\n\\n   action getKey() returns number\\n       return key\\n   end\\nend\\n\"\n}"
