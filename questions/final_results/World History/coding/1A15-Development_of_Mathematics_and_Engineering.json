The initial code developed by Aoki was giving the wrong answers, but Alex worked collaboratively made a few changes that fixed the code. It underwent several iterations before becoming correct, but Alex forgot to document what changes they made to fix the errors. What would be the appropriate explanation Alex should provide to describe the changes they made?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"I just combined a couple of variables and functions without following any particular process.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"I changed the algorithm multiple times and somehow it worked in the end.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"I tested the program after each change, adjusted different parts of the code based on the error messages and incorrect outputs until it produced the correct area calculations.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"I tried different things until it worked, but I can't exactly recall what those were.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"An integral part of the development of any code involves the process of debugging and refining it multiple times, termed as the iterative process. In Alex's case, they meticulously tested the code after every change, identified errors, and made necessary corrections until the code started producing the correct results. Such a process of trial and error using organized testing and debugging is a typical coding practice in iterative development.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action Main\\n   number side1 = 5.0\\n   number side2 = 3.0\\n   number side3 = 7.0\\n   number semiPerimeter = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2\\n   number area = squareRoot(semiPerimeter * (semiPerimeter - side1) * (semiPerimeter - side2) * (semiPerimeter - side3))\\n   output \\\"Area of the triangle is \\\"+ area\\nend\"\n}"
