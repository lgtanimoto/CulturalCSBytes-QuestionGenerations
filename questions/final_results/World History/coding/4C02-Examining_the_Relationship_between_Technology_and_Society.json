They have been researching how technology shapes society, and vice versa. As part of a school project, they are writing a program that models the layers of a computer system (application software, system software, and hardware). The program aims to demonstrate the integrations and interactions that exist between these layers. Referencing the code snippet, which statement incorrectly describes how these layers interact?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Application software relies on the system software to manage interactions with the hardware.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"System software directly interacts with the hardware to carry out tasks.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Hardware can perform tasks without any input from the system or application software.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Application software uses system software's functionalities provided as interfaces to interact with the hardware.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Hardware cannot perform tasks by itself without being directed by system software, which acts as an intermediary between the hardware and the application software. Incorrect assumptions can lead to programming errors when developing software.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"class Layer\\n    var name\\n    var parentLayer\\n\\n    action Layer(String layerName, Layer parent)\\n        name = layerName\\n        parentLayer = parent\\n    end\\n\\n    action ExecuteTask(String task)\\n        if(parentLayer != null)\\n            output \\\"Executing '\\\" + task + \\\"' on \\\" + name + \\\" through \\\" + parentLayer.name\\n            parentLayer.ExecuteTask(task)\\n        else\\n            output \\\"Task '\\\" + task + \\\"' completed at hardware level\\\"\\n        end\\n    end\\nend\\n\\nLayer appSoftware = new Layer(\\\"Application Software\\\", null)\\nLayer sysSoftware = new Layer(\\\"System Software\\\", appSoftware)\\nLayer hardware = new Layer(\\\"Hardware\\\", sysSoftware)\\n\\nhardware.ExecuteTask(\\\"Open File\\\")\"\n}"
