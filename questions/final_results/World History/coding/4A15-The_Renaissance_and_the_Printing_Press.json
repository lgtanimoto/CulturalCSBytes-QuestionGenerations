They've created a piece of code that represents the spread of ideas through different cities with the advent of the printing press. Based on the given code snippet, which of the following control structures could be justified in order to ensure the efficient propagation of knowledge?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Adding a 'for-loop' to iterate over each city and check if all individuals in that city have gained knowledge about the printing press.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Creating a 'while-loop' to continually spread the knowledge to other cities until all cities have received the knowledge.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Incorporating an 'if-else' condition to determine the fastest method to spread knowledge (either through word-of-mouth or through the printing press).\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Adding multiple 'if' conditions to control the spread of knowledge based on geographical location and population density.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"'While-loop' would be an appropriate structure because the loop will continue to spread knowledge until all cities have received the information. The other options could be inefficient as they do not guarantee that all cities will be covered.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action SpreadKnowledge(Class city[])\\n    integer i = 0\\n    while i < city.Length\\n        if city[i].hasPrintingPress\\n            city[i].spreadKnowledgeToAll()\\n        end\\n        i = i + 1\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
