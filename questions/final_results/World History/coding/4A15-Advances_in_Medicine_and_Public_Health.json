They are currently debating between two methods to track the number of infections over time in each region. Method A uses a for loop to step through each day and update the counts, while Method B uses a while loop that stops once there haven't been any changes in the counts for three consecutive days. Which method should Alex choose to use?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Method A, because it is easier to read and understand.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Method B, because it will use less computation time in situations where the infection numbers stabilize quickly.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Method A, because it will ensure that all data is taken into account, irrespective of the rate of change in infection numbers.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Method B, because it allows for more real-time analysis and can stop tracking once the numbers stabilize, hence saving computational resources.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"For this application, real-time analysis is critical as it can aid in quicker decision making. Method B seems more feasible as it not only takes care of the computational efficiency but also focuses on the real time tracking and control of disease spread.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"Method A:\\naction MethodA()\\n    for each day in days\\n        updateCounts()\\n    end\\nend\\n\\nMethod B:\\naction MethodB()\\n    integer constant = 3\\n    while updateCounts() and constant > 0\\n        constant -= 1\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
