Alex has already created the functionality for the calculator, but wants to incorporate user feedback to improve the interface. Alex asks Jordan and Riley to take a look at the code below. Considering their perspectives, what should Alex do next?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex should disregard their feedback because they are the primary developer.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex should change the color of the numerals on the calculator.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex should ask them for feedback regarding the user interface.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex should explain why the code is written the way it is and why it is the most effective method.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"An integral part of developing successful programs is obtaining user feedback. This feedback provides the developer with alternative perspectives, leading to improved functionality and accessibility. In turn, the users feel valued and are more likely to use and recommend the product.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"class Calculator\\n    action Add(integer a, integer b)\\n        return a + b\\n    end\\n    action Subtract(integer a, integer b)\\n        return a - b\\n    end\\n    action Multiply(integer a, integer b)\\n        return a * b\\n    end\\n    action Divide(integer a, integer b)\\n        if b != 0\\n            return a / b\\n        end\\n        return 0\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
