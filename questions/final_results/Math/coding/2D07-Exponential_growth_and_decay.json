Alex wrote this program to calculate the bacterial population after a certain number of hours given an initial population size. What is the output produced by this program if Alex provides 10 as the initial population and 3 as the number of hours?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"80\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"40\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"20\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"60\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The population doubles every hour, so after a given number of hours, the population is initial population * 2^number of hours. In this case, that is 10 * 2^3 = 80.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action CalculatePopulation (integer initialPopulation, integer numberOfHours) returns integer\\n    return initialPopulation * 2^numberOfHours\\nend\"\n}"
