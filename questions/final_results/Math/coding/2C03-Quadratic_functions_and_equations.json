However, the code is not giving the correct output. The output should be real roots, but the program is giving complex roots. How can Alex fix the problem?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Change the input values of a, b, and c\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Change the calculation of discriminant\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Change the calculation of the roots\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Input complex values for a, b, and c\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"When a problem occurs with the software, Alex needs to understand how the quadratic roots function works and use that knowledge to debug the problem. In this case, the wrong output may be due to incorrect computation of the roots.
