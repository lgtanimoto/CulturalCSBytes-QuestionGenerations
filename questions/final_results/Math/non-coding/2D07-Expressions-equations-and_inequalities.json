Each player starts with a certain number of points, and gains or loses points based on the cards they play during the game. At any time, a player's points can be calculated with the following expression: \\\"player's starting points - points lost + points gained = player's current points\\\". Today, Alex started with 50 points. During the game, they lost 35 points and gained 20 points. How many points does Alex have now?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"45 points\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"40 points\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"35 points\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"50 points\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"By substituting the values into the expression, we find that 50 - 35 + 20 = 35. Therefore, Alex has 35 points.\"\n}"
