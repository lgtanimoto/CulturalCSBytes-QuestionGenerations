They know that the colony doubles every hour. Which one of the following could be the procedure for this calculation, where 'P' represents the initial population and 'H' represents the number of hours?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"procedure CalculatePopulation(P, H)returns number P = P * (2/H)end\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"procedure CalculatePopulation(P, H)returns number P = P * Hend\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"procedure CalculatePopulation(P, H)returns number P = P * 2^Hend\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"procedure CalculatePopulation(P, H)returns number P = P * H^2end\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In the case of exponential growth, such as the doubling of a bacteria population, we use the formula P * 2^H. In this expression, 'P' represents the initial population and '2^H' represents the doubling of the population every hour 'H'.\"\n}"
