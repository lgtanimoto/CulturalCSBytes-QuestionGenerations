They plan to design an encryption algorithm to secure their diagrams, but they also want to make it easy for their classmates to decrypt the images with a provided key. Which of the following options would strike a good balance between security and usability in this context?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex uses a very complex encryption algorithm which requires multiple compute-intensive steps to decrypt, ensuring high security but potentially making it difficult for their classmates to perform the decryption.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex decides not to encrypt the diagrams at all, arguing that the decryption process may be too much of a hindrance for their classmates.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex uses a simple encryption algorithm and provides detailed steps on how to perform the decryption with the provided key, ensuring both reasonable security and ease of use.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex designs their own highly intricate encryption approach that is hard to crack, but does not provide any directions on how classmates can decrypt the images.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Good security measures strike a balance between being secure enough to protect against threats, but still user-friendly enough to be practical. In this case, a simple encryption sufficient for the content combined with clear instructions on how to use the provided key for decryption allows Alex's classmates easy access to the diagrams while still keeping them secure.\"\n}"
