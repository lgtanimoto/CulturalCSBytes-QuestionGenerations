Concerned with the security of their personal data, Alex contacted the site owner, who said they would implement HTTPS but it may slow down the website performance. Which of the following is the best interpretation of the site owner's message?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"The site owner will implement HTTPS causing all user data to be safely encrypted, but the site may load slower due to the time taken to encrypt and decrypt data.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"The site owner will implement HTTPS which will speed up the site by allowing it to handle more data.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The site owner plans to make the site less secure by encrypting only part of the user's data to maintain site speed.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex's connection speed to the site will become slower, but the site owner will gain faster access to Alex's data.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Using HTTPS protects the integrity of your site and the privacy and security of your users. However, the encryption and decryption process can increase the time it takes for data to travel between a server and a client causing a potential decrease in performance.\"\n}"
