She has two options: 1) A system with a highly sophisticated firewall that is excellent at preventing cybersecurity breaches, but it blocks some educational websites used frequently by students, or 2) A system with good security and no restrictions that, however, requires regular manual checks and updates from her. What would be the best choice for Alex's school, considering the trade-offs of each system?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Choose the first system because total prevention of cybersecurity breaches is most important.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Choose the second system because unrestricted access to educational resources is essential for learning.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Choose the first system assuming students can find alternatives to the blocked educational websites.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Choose the second system, provided Aila has the capacity for regular manual checks and updates.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"While the first system provides an excellent security firewall, it restricts access to certain educational websites. The second option, despite requiring regular manual checks and updates, ensures good security while maintaining important access to education resources. As long as the school's IT capacity allows it, the second system is perhaps the more balanced choice, demonstrating that policy decisions in cybersecurity involve careful consideration of the trade-offs involved.\"\n}"
