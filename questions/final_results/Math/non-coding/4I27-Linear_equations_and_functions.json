Alex aims to collaborate with students from different parts of the world, who have diverse mathematical skills. How can Alex most effectively manage this project to ensure smooth cross-cultural collaboration and achieve their goal?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex should work individually and avoid collaboration.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex should use collaboration tools (like Google Docs, Trello, etc.) for project management, and video-conferencing tools (like Zoom, MS Teams, etc.) for face-to-face interactions to clear doubts and exchange ideas.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex should ask their peers to follow their method and approach only.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex should make all the decisions for the team.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The use of digital tools can dramatically enhance the collaboration process by providing a platform for sharing ideas, having face-to-face interactions, and managing the project progress collectively.
