This program should be able to take in three parameters: a, b, and c from the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, and return the solutions for x. Which of the steps below would be included in a plan that describes this program\u2019s sequence of events?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"1. Accept inputs a, b & c 2. Calculate x using the formula (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a 3. Return the value of x.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"1. Accept inputs a, b & c 2. Compute \u0394 as b^2 - 4ac. 3. If \u0394 < 0, there are no real solutions. 4. If \u0394 = 0, there is one solution, which is -b / (2a). 5. If \u0394 > 0, there are two solutions, which are (-b \u00b1 sqrt(\u0394)) / (2a).\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"1. Accept inputs a, b & c 2. Check if a = 0. If yes, then it's not a quadratic equation. 3. Calculate the values of x using the formula x = -c / b. 4. Return the value of x.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"1. Accept inputs a, b & c 2. Compute \u0394 as a^2 - 4bc. 3. If \u0394 < 0, there are no real solutions. 4. If \u0394 = 0, there is one solution, which is -b / (2a). 5.
