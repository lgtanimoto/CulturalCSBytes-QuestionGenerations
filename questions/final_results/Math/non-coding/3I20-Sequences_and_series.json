Alex uses two kinds of software to complete the task: Software A, which processes the entire CSV file at once but is prone to crashing if the file is too large, and Software B, which processes the CSV file line by line but takes a longer time to complete. If the CSV file has 1000 lines and Software A can process 500 lines before crashing, which of the following is a possible tradeoff Alex is considering?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex should use Software A to process the CSV file quickly, and restart the software every time it crashes.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex should use Software B to process the CSV file to avoid crashing, even if it takes longer.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex should consider investing in a more expensive and powerful computer to handle running Software A without it crashing.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex should consider finding another job since neither options are ideal.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In the world of computing, trade-offs need to be carefully evaluated. In Alex's case, even though Software B takes longer, it is more reliable and does not have a risk of crashing halfway through the task. This trade-off allows Alex to complete their task without potential loss of data or re-doing work, showing how they prioritize reliability over speed in their daily activities and work.\"\n}"
