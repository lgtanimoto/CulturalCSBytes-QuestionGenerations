Alex loves to use visual aids to help them understand concepts better and they decided to visualize these concepts using a pie chart. Each slice of the pie chart represents a different fraction, decimal, and percentage. Can you help Alex write a code to create an interactive pie chart where each slice represents a different fraction, decimal and percentage when clicked?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"'PieChart' class in Python cannot create interactive pie charts\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Use matplotlib in Python to create an interactive pie chart\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Use seaborn in Python to create an interactive pie chart\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Use 'PieChart' class in JavaScript to create an interactive pie chart\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"matplotlib library in Python can create interactive pie charts. When you hover over each slice, you can see the respective fraction, decimal, or percentage.\"\n}"
