However, Alex wants to introduce a factor to represent a natural disaster such as a fire or flood, which can remove half of the population in one month. Which event should trigger the execution of the function to represent the disaster?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"When the population of rabbits exceeds a certain limit\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"When the algorithm starts\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"After every iteration of multiplying the rabbit population\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"When the function to calculate the rabbit population has finished\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"A natural disaster should occur when the population becomes too large, so triggering the execution of the disaster function when the rabbit population exceeds a certain limit best represents this phenomenon. \"\n}"
