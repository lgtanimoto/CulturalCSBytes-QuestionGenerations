Alex divides the roles among the team: Jordan calculates the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac), Pat solves for x using the plus part of the \u00b1 and Chris solves for x using the minus part of the \u00b1. If the discriminant is 0, the roots are real and equal. If it is greater than 0, the roots are real and unequal, and if it less than zero, the roots are complex. How should Alex structure the program flow among the team members?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Jordan calculates the discriminant -> Pat solves for x using + -> Chris solves for x using - -> Determine if roots are real or complex or equal based on the discriminant.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Determine if roots are real or complex or equal based on the discriminant -> Jordan calculates the discriminant -> Pat solves for x using + -> Chris solves for x using -\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Jordan calculates the discriminant -> Determine if roots are real or complex or equal based on the discriminant -> Pat solves for x using + -> Chris solves for x using -\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Pat solves for x using + -> Chris solves for x using - -> Jordan calculates the discriminant -> Determine if roots are real or complex or equal based on the discriminant\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Jordan should first calculate the discriminant, then determine if roots are real, imaginary or equal. Depending on the discriminant, Pat and Chris would then solve for x, either with real or complex math. Thus, the flow should be: Calculate the discriminant -> Determine the nature of the roots -> Pat solves for +x -> Chris solves for -x.\"\n}"
