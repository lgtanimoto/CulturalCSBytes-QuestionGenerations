To ensure smooth transitions of the music they plan to use programming. Which programming patterns should Alex consider to implement this feature?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Create a sequence of music pieces that plays continuously, regardless of the events in the game\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Use conditionals to play different music pieces based on the character's actions, and loops to replay each music piece\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Use a loop to constantly check if an event has occurred and play a sound effect if it has\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Randomly select a music piece whenever the game is loaded\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Alex should use a conditional code structure to determine which music piece to play based on different events in the game. This can make the gameplay more engaging as it provides the player a more immersive experience. Furthermore, loops can be used to keep checking the game's status to determine if the music should change.\"\n}"
