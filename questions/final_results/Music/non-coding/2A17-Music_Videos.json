To make the videos more accessible, Alex intends to write a program that will present subtitle files along with the videos. The program must understand the time-based format of the subtitles and sync them with the video. As Alex\u2019s friend and an amateur programmer, you volunteer to help Alex write this program. Which of the following programs, including comments, would best fit the purpose?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"//This program reads text from a file line by line.action lyrical(integer fileName)readLine(fileName)repeat until endOfFile(fileName)output lineend\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"//This program counts the number of words in a line. action lyrical(number fileName)readLine(fileName)repeat until endOfFile(fileName)s = length(line)output send\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"//This program reads subtitle files and syncs them with the video. action lyrical(song,fileName)start songsequence = 0repeat until endOfFile(fileName)readLine(fileName)  subtime = extractTime(sequence)  if song.currenttime = subtime output line  sequence = sequence + 1\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"//This program reads a list of lyric files. action lyrical(integer fileName)readList(fileName)repeat until endOfFile(fileName)output listItemend\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The third program includes clear comments and demonstrates the processes the program will undertake. It clearly relates to Alex's task. The program reads the subtitle file line by line, extracting the time from the current line and comparing it against the current playback time of the song. When those times match, the program outputs the corresponding line of the subtitle which would be the subs for that moment in the video.\"\n}"
