Each friend has a different role: Alex as the project manager, Charlie as the designer, Casey as the programmer, and Dana as the tester. What are some tasks each friend could do in their role during the stages of program development?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex sets the project timeline and organizes meetings. Charlie sketches out the visual effects. Casey writes the code. Dana tests the program and reports on what is not working.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex writes the code. Charlie tests the program. Casey sets the project timeline. Dana sketches out the visual effects.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"All friends should write code for the program because it is a software program.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex and Charlie sketch out the visual effects. Casey and Dana work on writing and testing the program.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In a software development project, different roles have different coherent sets of tasks.  Alex as the project manager organizes the project and keeps it moving.  Charlie as the designer creates diagrams or sketches that show the structure and behaviour of the software being created. Casey as the programmer writes the software based on Charlie's diagrams or sketches and Alex's priorities.  Dana as the tester tries the software and feeds back information to the team about what is and isn't working.\"\n}"
