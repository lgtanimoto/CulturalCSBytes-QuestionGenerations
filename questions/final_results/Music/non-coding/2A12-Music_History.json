One day, Alex stumbled upon an open-source project that provided song reviews but not any of the other features Alex have in their app. Now, Alex wants to incorporate some of the code from this project to better their own app while also adding some new features. What are some of the steps you would recommend for Alex to successfully achieve their goal?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Just copy and paste the entire code into their program without any understanding or modification whatsoever\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Understand the existing code from the open-source project, identify portions that could improve their existing app, modify them if needed, and reimplement these portions into their own app\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Start their project again from scratch and try to rewrite the entire app\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Ignore the source code as looking at other people's work is unethical\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The best way to utilize an open source project is to understand the source code well and then identify the portions which could be used to enhance the existing program. These portions should then be appropriately modified, if necessary, and implemented in the existing program. This not only improves the quality of the program but also saves effort and time.\"\n}"
