Which of the following does NOT apply to how music composition and arrangement has evolved due to technology?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"With music notation software, Alex can play back the music to hear how it sounds, which was not possible with traditional hand-written notation.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"New technology enables songs to be composed faster and more accurately without human errors in counting measures or lines.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Music notation software allows for easier sharing and collaboration, rather than waiting for handwritten composition to be manually distributed.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Composing music with software has caused the creativity and emotion behind compositions to be lost, unlike in the past when music was written by hand.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"While it is true that technology has made it easier to compose and arrange music, it doesn't necessarily mean that the creativity and emotion behind writing music have been lost.
