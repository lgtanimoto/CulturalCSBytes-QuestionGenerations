They are creating a program in Python that will list all the entries, select a random film as the feature presentation, and play a short piece of music before each screening. Select the code snippet that best describes what Alex is doing.\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"import randomfilmList = ['Film A', 'Film B', 'Film C', 'Film D']featureFilm = random.choice(filmList)for film in filmList:print(film)if film == featureFilm:print('Now playing the feature presentation!')else:print('Now playing a short piece of music...')\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"import randomfilmList = ['Film A', 'Film B', 'Film C', 'Film D']random.shuffle(filmList)for film in filmList:print(film)print('Now playing a short piece of music...')\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"import randomfilmList = ['Film A', 'Film B', 'Film C', 'Film D']for film in filmList:print(film)potluck = random.randint(0, len(filmList)-1)if filmList[potluck] == film:print('Now playing the feature presentation!')else:print('Now playing a short piece of music...')\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"import randomfilmList = ['Film A', 'Film B', 'Film C', 'Film D']featureFilm = random.choice(filmList)for film in filmList:if film == featureFilm:print(film + ' is the featured presentation!')else:print(film + ' will be preceded by a short piece of music.')\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In this scenario, Alex first creates a list of films. They then select a random film using random.choice(), and start a loop to iterate over the film list. For each film, they print the film title. If the current film is the feature presentation, they print an additional message. Else, a short piece of music is played before the screening.\"\n}"
