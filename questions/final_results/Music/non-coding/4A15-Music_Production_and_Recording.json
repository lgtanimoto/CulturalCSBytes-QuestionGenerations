The program needs to accept an input of trackID and volume level. Which control structure is likely the most beneficial for Alex to use in this scenario?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"An iterative structure, such as a loop, to continuously adjust the volume levels of all the tracks in the DAW.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"A sequence structure that processes the volume adjustment in the order that the trackIDs are input.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"A selection structure, such as an 'if/else' statement, that adjusts the volume based on the condition that the trackID is correct.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"A concurrent structure that will adjust the volume of multiple tracks at the same time.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In this situation, a selection structure like 'if/else' would be beneficial as it allows the program to adjust the volume based on the condition that the specific trackID is selected. Using an 'if/else' structure would ensure the correct track is selected and the appropriate volume adjustment is made, promoting program accuracy and efficiency.\"\n}"
