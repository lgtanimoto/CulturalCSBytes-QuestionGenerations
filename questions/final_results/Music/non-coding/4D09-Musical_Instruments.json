Each note corresponds to a different frequency: G3 is 196 Hz, D4 is 293.66 Hz, A4 is 440 Hz, and E5 is 659.26 Hz. Alex's goal is to input the frequency as binary, and output the note as a string. Given the following piece of code that Alex wrote, which modifies the function `returnNote` should Alex make to properly translate the input frequency to a corresponding note?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"if frequency == 11000100 return 'G3'else if frequency == 100100101.1010 return 'D4'else if frequency == 110110100 return 'A4'else if frequency == 1010001010.0100 return 'E5'\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"if frequency == 11000100 return 'G3'else if frequency == 100100101 return 'D4'else if frequency == 110110100 return 'A4'else if frequency == 1010001010 return 'E5'\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"if frequency == '11000100' return 'G3'else if frequency == '100100101.1010' return 'D4'else if frequency == '110110100' return 'A4'else if frequency == '1010001010.0100' return 'E5'\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"if frequency == '11000100' return 'G3'else if frequency == '100100101' return 'D4'else if frequency == '110110100' return 'A4'else if frequency == '1010001010' return 'E5'\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Binary representation of numbers in computers do not include decimal points and hence the decimal point in Answers 1 and 3 make no sense. Between Answers 2 and 4, a string comparison would fail because the input frequency should be treated as a binary number. Hence Answer 2 is the correct code adjustment.\"\n}"
