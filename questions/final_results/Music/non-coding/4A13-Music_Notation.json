They are working on a function that receives a note name such as 'C', 'D', 'E', etc., and should return the corresponding frequency in Hz. Which of the following pseudocodes represents a possible correct solution for this problem?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"action GetFrequency(NoteName) returns number: if NoteName = 'C' then return 261.63, if NoteName = 'D' then return 293.66, if NoteName = 'E' then return 329.63, if NoteName = 'F' then return 349.23, if NoteName = 'G' then return 392.00, if NoteName = 'A' then return 440.00, if NoteName = 'B' then return 493.88, else return 0 end\", \n    \"Answer2\": \"action GetFrequency(NoteName) returns none: print 'C' - 261.63, 'D' - 293.66, 'E' - 329.63, 'F' - 349.23, 'G' - 392.00, 'A' - 440.00, 'B' - 493.88 end\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"action GetFrequency(NoteName) returns number: while NoteName = 'C' return 261.63, while NoteName = 'D' return 293.66, while NoteName = 'E' return 329.63, while NoteName = 'F' return 349.23, while NoteName = 'G' return 392.00, while NoteName = 'A' return 440.00, while NoteName = 'B' return 493.88, return 0 end\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"action GetFrequency(NoteName) returns number: for each note in NoteName: if note = 'C' return 261.63, else if note = 'D' return 293.66, else if note = 'E' return 329.63, else if note = 'F' return 349.23, else if note = 'G' return 392.00, else if note = 'A' return 440.00, else if note = 'B' return 493.88, end return 0 end\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Answer 1 is the correct solution. It treats each individual note as a unique case and assigns the correct frequency. Meanwhile, Answers 2 and 3 are incorrect as they either don't return any value or use a while statement unnecessarily. Answer 4 unwittingly iterates over the characters of NoteName which is not the intended behavior.\"\n}"
