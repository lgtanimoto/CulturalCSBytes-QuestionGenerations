Their model uses a database of thousands of songs, each categorized by its decade and musical style. The goal of Alex's model is to estimate the popularity of different musical styles in each decade. Which of the following mechanisms would be the most effective way for Alex's model to achieve this goal?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Count the total number of songs from each musical style and divide by the total number of songs to get the percentage of each musical style.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Count the total number of songs from each musical style in each decade and divide by the total number of songs in that decade to get the percentage of each musical style in each decade.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Count the total number of songs from each musical style in each decade and divide by the total number of decades the musical style was present to get the average popularity of each musical style in each decade.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Count the total number of songs from each musical style in each decade and divide by the total number of songs from all musical styles to get the percentage of each musical style in each decade.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Alex's goal is to estimate the popularity of different musical styles in each decade. The most effective way to achieve this goal is to calculate the percentage of songs from each musical style in each decade compared to the total number of songs in that decade. This will give them a clear view of how each musical style's popularity changed over time.\"\n}"
