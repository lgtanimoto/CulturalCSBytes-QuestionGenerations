The program should take a note as input and return the corresponding frequency. The original code only contains a start but Alex isn't sure what they should do next. What steps should Alex take next to complete their program?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Add a sequence condition to recognize different musical notes and assign them their respective frequencies.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Create a loop that will keep assigning frequencies randomly to each note, until it finds the right one.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Hard code each frequency for every possible musical note.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Connect the program to a musical instrument to input the frequencies automatically.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Alex could create a sequence of conditions that, given a certain musical note as input, would return the corresponding frequency.
