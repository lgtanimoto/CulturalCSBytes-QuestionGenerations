    "question_str": "{\n    \"Question\": \"Alex loves to sing and is renowned for their pitch perfect renditions. Recently, they decided to write a Quorum program that will help novices match the correct pitch. The program produces an audio output corresponding to the base pitch, has a sampling audio input to capture the user's pitch and then compares both to deliver feedback. Alex runs several tests but sadly some users are still off-pitch according to the program while they swear they were pitch perfect. Alex is confused and needs to troubleshoot. What systematic troubleshooting strategy should Alex adopt for this program?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Check if the microphone configured with the program is working correctly and not introducing any noise that might alter the captured pitch.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Repeatedly run the program and hope it corrects the problem automatically.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Ask users to sing louder, in case the program is not capturing their pitch correctly due to low volume.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Adjust the audio output's pitch, in case it is not producing the correct base pitch.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Given the described scenario, a logical first step would be to ensure that the input source, the microphone, is capturing the sound correctly. While the other steps can be part of a larger troubleshooting plan, the most systematic start would be to examine the status and performance of the microphone.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"output \\\"Base pitch: G4\\\"\\n// code to produce audio output for G4\\n\\n// sample user input\\nuser_pitch = capture_audio_input()\\n\\n// compare user pitch with base pitch\\nif(user_pitch == 'G4')\\n   output \\\"Perfect pitch!\\\"\\nelse\\n   output \\\"Try again. Listen to the base pitch closely.\\\"\"\n}"
