She is sending out a survey to all students to collect data. The survey asks students to rate their confidence in their social skills and the quality of their relationships with classmates on a scale from 1 (Poor) to 5 (Excellent). What would be the best way for Cheyenne to prepare the survey data for analysis in her app?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"She can convert the ratings into binary numbers, where 5 equals 111, 4 equals 110, 3 equals 101, 2 equals 100, and 1 equals 001.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"She can use a simple count of how many students rated their confidence and relationships at each level.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"She can group the students into different categories based on the number of times they collaborate with classmates during group projects.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"She can create a pie chart to visually represent the percentage of students at each rating level.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Answer B is the best approach because it allows you to analyze the data numerically and gives you a clear understanding of the overall social skills confidence and relationship quality across the student body. The other answers could provide additional information but the basic numerical analysis will be the most straightforward way to understand the data at first.\"\n}"
