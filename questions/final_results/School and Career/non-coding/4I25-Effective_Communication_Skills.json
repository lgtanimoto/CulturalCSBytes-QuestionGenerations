It uses a historical dataset with transcripts of effective communications from various cultures. However, Serge, a fellow student, points out that there might be inherent biases in the model towards certain cultures or languages because the development team is predominantly English-speaking. How could Alex refine their computational artifact to ensure it addresses this bias and promotes equity?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex could ignore Serge's feedback since the team's experience largely aligns with the intended user's culture.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex could choose to only use English communication data to train the model.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex could consult with experts from diverse cultures and languages to help refine the artifacts and validate the model before deploying it.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex could integrate a built-in translator to address the language bias.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"To ensure equity, Alex should bring in experts from a variety of cultures and languages. This will help them train the model with a more diverse dataset and validate its functionality across diverse cultures, which reduces bias and promotes fairness.\"\n}"
