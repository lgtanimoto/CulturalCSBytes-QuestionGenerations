They also want to keep a journal of their thoughts and feelings. Alex plans to do this in a spreadsheet, so that they can easily input, modify, and analyse their data. For the first week, Alex diligently inputs the data, and at the end of the week, they analyse it to see trends and areas of improvement. They have been feeling low and lethargic in the evenings, so they first check to see if they can find a correlation between their diet, exercise, sleep, and moods. How did Alex use their computing device to define the information stored as data?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex measured, recorded, and input the metrics (intake, exercise, sleep) and subjective data (moods) into a spreadsheet.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex decided on their health and wellness goals and identified the factors that would help them achieve these goals.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex analysed their data to make meaningful deductions, observe patterns and correlations.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex shared their data with a friend for accountability and support.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Multiple steps of Alex's routine involve data - measurement, entry, analysis, etc. However, defining information as data specifically refers to the step where Alex recorded and inputted metrics and moods into a spreadsheet. The structure, format, and consistency make it usable as data for whatever purpose Alex chooses, including retrieval, analysis, sharing, modification, or synthesis into new information.\"\n}"
