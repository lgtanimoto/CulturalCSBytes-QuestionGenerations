They want to keep track of the colleges they are applying to, the application due dates, the admission results, and the application cost for each college.  Furthermore, Alex wants to compare each college by multiple criteria, such as their acceptance rate, financial aid package, offered majors, and location. After building the database, Alex decides to add a new attribute to track, the study abroad programs each college offers. However, adding this attribute will require creating a new table and updating existing records. From a data organization perspective, what should Alex most likely consider before making this change?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Does Alex need immediate access to the data or can it be batch processed overnight?\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Can the study abroad programs be accurately and uniquely mapped to individual colleges?\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Does Alex need comprehensive information or will basic information be enough for comparing colleges?\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Will the computational resources be adequate to support the database enlargement?\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"From a data organization perspective, Alex needs to consider if the study abroad programs can be accurately and uniquely mapped to individual colleges. This information will determine how Alex will modify the existing database structure to accommodate the new attribute. The other choices are primarily regarding system requirements, data quality, or data processing strategy, which are less critical when it comes to structuring the database.\"\n}"
