They start with an initial balance of $500. Each month they plan to deposit $200 more into the account. After such deposits in the first, second, third and fourth month, their account balances will be $700, $900, $1,100, and $1,300, respectively. Alex wishes to find out the account balance after n months. Which of the following programs will correctly calculate Alex's balance in the savings account after n months?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"action Savings (integer n)number initialBalance = 500.0repeat n timesinitialBalance = initialBalance + 200endreturn initialBalanceend\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"action Savings (integer n)number balance = 500.0repeat n-1 timesbalance = balance + 200endreturn balanceend\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"action Savings (integer n)number balance = 0.0repeat n timesbalance = balance + 200endreturn balanceend\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"action Savings (integer n)number balance = 500.0number deposit = 200.0repeat n timesbalance = balance + depositdeposit = deposit + 200endreturn balanceend\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"At the beginning, Alex has $500 in their savings account. Each month they deposit $200 into the account. The total balance in the account after n months would be the initial savings of $500 plus the total deposits they make over n months. Hence, the correct program would start the balance at $500 and inside a loop repeating n times, each time add $200 to the balance.\"\n}"
