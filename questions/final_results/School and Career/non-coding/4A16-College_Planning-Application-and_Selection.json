Alex's idea is to make the system interactive and engaging by initiating certain instructions when a user hovers over or clicks on different universities in a map. Which of the following is the best approach for Alex to take?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Create a static map with all universities and list details next to the map. When a user hovers over a university, use programming to highlight the university's name in the list.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Create a map with clickable universities. When a user hovers over a university, display a pop-up with basic details. When a user clicks, guide them to a detailed page about the university.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Develop a single page with a list of all universities. When a user clicks on a university's name, redirect them to the university's official website.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Create an interactive map where users can hover over universities to see their names. However, do not include any other details or clickable functions.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Alex's idea is to use events (hovering and clicking) to initiate instructions (display details or navigate to more detailed page). Option 2 perfectly aligns with this concept, making the system interactive. Other options are either not interactive, do not make use of events, or do not offer as comprehensive a user experience.\"\n}"
