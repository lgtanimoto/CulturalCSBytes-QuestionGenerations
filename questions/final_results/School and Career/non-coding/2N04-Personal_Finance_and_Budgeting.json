    "question_str": "{\n    \"Question\": \"Alex is planning their monthly budget using an online budgeting app. They input their income and expenses into the app which processes this data and presents a breakdown of their spending in various categories. This information is then sent back to Alex's computer for them to review. How does this information go from Alex's computer to the web server and back?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"The app creates a dedicated and permanent connection with Alex's computer. Information is continuously sent back and forth over this connection.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex's income and expense data is split into multiple packets which are sent to the server. After being processed, the server sends these packets back to Alex's computer which reassembles them to display the budget breakdown.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The information is sent in one large 'packet' from Alex's computer. After being processed, this singular packet is sent back to Alex's computer.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex's income and expense data is converted into binary and transmitted to the web server as a continuous stream. This stream is then converted back into comprehensible data for Alex to review.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"When data needs to be transmitted over the internet, it is typically broken down into smaller pieces, known as packets. These packets are sent independently of one another over the network and reassembled once they reach their destination.\"\n}"
