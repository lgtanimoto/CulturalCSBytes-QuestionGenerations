Alex decided to write a program that can track the number of steps they've walked each day, calculate their weekly total, and determine whether they met their goal. How can Alex go about constructing this program?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex needs to create a variable for each day of the week, manually input steps, and then manually calculate whether they met the goal.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex can organize steps into a list with seven elements, loop over the list to calculate total steps, and then determine if the total is at least 70,000.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex can create a function to calculate the total steps and a function to check whether the total is at least 70,000. Then, input the steps manually for each day.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex needs to manually calculate the steps for every day, and then create an 'if-else' condition to determine if they met their goal.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The easiest way to achieve this is to use a list and a loop. The steps for each day can be stored in a list. Alex can then use a loop to iterate over the list, totaling the steps. Finally, a condition can compare the total to 70,000 to check if Alex managed to achieve their goal.\", \n    \"code_snippet\": \"steps = [8000, 9000, 11000, 8500, 10000, 10500, 9500]\\ntotal_steps = 0\\nfor i in steps:\\n    total_steps += i\\nif total_steps >= 70000:\\n    print('Goal achieved!')\\nelse:\\n    print('Keep going, you'll get there!')\"\n}"
