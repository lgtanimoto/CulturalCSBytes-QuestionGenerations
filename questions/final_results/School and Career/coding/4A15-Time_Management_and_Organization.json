The app includes a feature to categorize and rank daily tasks based on priority levels (high, medium, low) and sort them accordingly. To implement this, Alex wrote the procedure categorizeTasks(). However, the procedure currently only categorizes tasks at 'high' priority correctly, while tasks at 'medium' and 'low' priorities are mixed up. Alex's friends tried the program and provided feedback. Which two of the test cases did Alex's friends report as not working as expected?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"categorizeTasks('Clean room', 'low')\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"categorizeTasks('Complete homework', 'high')\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"categorizeTasks('Buy groceries', 'medium')\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"categorizeTasks('Finish project', 'low')\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1,3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Alex's procedure correctly sorts tasks with 'high' priority. Hence, categorizeTasks('Complete homework', 'high') would provide the expected output. However, it's unable to correctly sort tasks categorized as 'medium' or 'low'. Therefore, categorizeTasks('Clean room', 'low') and categorizeTasks('Buy groceries', 'medium') do not provide the expected outputs.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action categorizeTasks(string task, string priority)\\n    if priority = 'high'\\n        output \\\"Scheduling: \\\" + task + \\\" as high priority\\\"\\n    else\\n        if priority = 'medium'\\n            output \\\"Scheduling: \\\" + task + \\\" as low priority\\\"\\n        else\\n            output \\\"Scheduling: \\\" + task + \\\" as medium priority\\\"\\n        end\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
