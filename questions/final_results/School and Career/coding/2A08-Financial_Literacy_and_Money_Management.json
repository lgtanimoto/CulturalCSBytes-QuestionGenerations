They aim to balance their weekly income and living costs, ensuring they are not overspending. Looking at the code they've written, Alex realizes there might be a more effective and efficient way to write the program:What change could make this code more efficient?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Calculating the net weekly balance outside of the loop\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Removing the lines of code that allocate money for living costs\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Running the loop backwards (from 30 days to 1 day)\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Increase the initial weekly income value\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Computing the net weekly balance (income - total living costs) outside of the 30-days loop would make the program more effective. The current method recalculates the balance for each day, which is unnecessary since the income and living costs are weekly fixed amounts and don't change every day. Thus, moving the balance calculation outside of the loop will make the program run more efficiently.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"number income = 500.0\\nnumber livingCosts = 250.0\\nnumber balance = 0.0\\ninteger days = 30\\n\\nrepeat times days\\n   balance = income - livingCosts\\n   output \\\"Day \\\" + days + \\\": $\\\" + balance\\n   days = days - 1\\n   if balance < 0.0\\n      output \\\"Warning: You're overspending.\\\"\\n   end\\nend\"\n}"
