While loops and If-Else statements can be used, but they do not offer the same level of readability and ease of implementation for this specific use case. Switch statements are not necessarily applicable because Alex isn't testing multiple conditions.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"integer days = 7\\nfor every day in days\\n    if day = 1\\n        output \\\"Cooking\\\"\\n    elseif day = 2\\n        output \\\"Gym\\\"\\n    else\\n        output \\\"Reading\\\"\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
