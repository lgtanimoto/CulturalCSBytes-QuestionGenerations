They are developing an algorithm to monitor their daily activities. They used two algorithms (algorithm A and algorithm B). Algorithm A tracks the time spent on physical activities such as working out, walking, etc., while algorithm B tracks meditating, reading, and other mental wellness activities.What aspect of the algorithms should Alex refine to get a more complete image of their overall wellness?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex should refine algorithm A to track mental wellness activities\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex should refine algorithm B to track physical health activities\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex should combine both algorithms to track both mental and physical wellness activities\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Both algorithms are adequate\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"To get a complete overview of their overall wellness, Alex needs to track both physical and mental wellness activities. Combining both algorithms A and B will provide Alex with the needed information.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"class Wellness \\n    integer physicalActivitiesTime \\n    integer mentalActivitiesTime \\n \\n    action PhysicalActivity(integer time) \\n        physicalActivitiesTime = physicalActivitiesTime + time \\n    end \\n \\n    action MentalActivity(integer time) \\n        mentalActivitiesTime = mentalActivitiesTime + time \\n    end \\nend\"\n}"
