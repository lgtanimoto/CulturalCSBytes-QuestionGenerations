He proposed the following exercise: 'Translate the following ASCII codes into their corresponding alphanumeric characters from the alphabet: 69, 110, 106, 111, 121, 65, 108, 101, 120, 33' What message is Alex trying to communicate?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"EcodeAlex!\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"EnjoyChris!\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"EnjoyAlex!\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"EnjoyCS!\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Each ASCII value corresponds to a character of the English alphabet. Translating these ASCII values results in the message 'EnjoyAlex!', which shows that Alex is encouraging his sister to have fun while learning to code with him.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"integer ascii_v = 69\\noutput \\\"Value of ASCII character \\\", ascii_v, \\\" is: '\\\", char(ascii_v), \\\"'\\\"\"\n}"
