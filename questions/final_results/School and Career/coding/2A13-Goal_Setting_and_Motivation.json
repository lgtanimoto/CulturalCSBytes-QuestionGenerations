They have a variety of friends with different interests and perspectives. In planning the development of the app, Alex intends to consider these varied preferences to make the app versatile. They share the following code snippet which will track the progress of a user's goal. What advice would best help Alex in planning the further development of the program?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Include only Alex's personal preferences for goal tracking to keep the development process simple.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Consider only the preferences of their programmer friends, as they would best represent the average user of the app.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Analyze the shared code with their friends of various backgrounds, asking for their input and preferences to include a wide range of user experiences.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Discard all preferences and create a standardized app with no customization options to streamline the user experience.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Alex's goal to create a versatile app would best be achieved by considering a wide range of preferences and perspectives, ideally from users with various backgrounds. This would not limit the app's utility to just programmers or certain types of users, and allows for a diverse set of preferences.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"integer goal = 0\\ninteger currentProgress = 0\\n\\naction UpdateProgress(number n)\\n   currentProgress = currentProgress + n\\n   if currentProgress >= goal\\n        output \\\"Goal Achieved!\\\"\\n   else\\n        output \\\"Keep going, you are doing great!\\\"\\n   end\\nend\"\n}"
