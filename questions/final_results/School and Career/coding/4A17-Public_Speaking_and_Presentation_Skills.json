They've decided to write a program that simulates the structure of an effective debate speech to help them plan better. What output will be produced by a call to the procedure 'CreateSpeech()' given in the program below?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"'Introduction\\\\nPoint 1\\\\nPoint 2\\\\nCounter-argument\\\\nConclusion\\\\nThank You'\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"'Introduction\\\\nPoint 1\\\\nCounter-argument\\\\nPoint 2\\\\nConclusion\\\\nThank You'\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"'Introduction\\\\nPoint 1\\\\nCounter-argument\\\\nConclusion\\\\nThank You'\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"'Introduction\\\\nPoint 1\\\\nPoint 2\\\\nConclusion\\\\nThank You'\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The structure follows the sequence in the 'CreateSpeech()' procedure: First, there is an Introduction, followed by Point 1 and Point 2. Then there is a counter-argument, which must be addressed before the Conclusion. Lastly, is a 'Thank You'. This overall structure allows for two main points with a counter-argument in between and ends with a strong conclusion.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action CreateSpeech()\\n    Introduction()\\n    MakePoint()\\n    MakePoint()\\n    CounterArgument()\\n    Conclusion()\\n    ThankYou()\\nend\\n\\naction Introduction()\\n    output 'Introduction'\\nend\\n\\naction MakePoint()\\n    output 'Point'\\nend\\n\\naction CounterArgument()\\n    output 'Counter-argument'\\nend\\n\\naction Conclusion()\\n    output 'Conclusion'\\nend\\n\\naction ThankYou()\\n    output 'Thank You'\\nend\"\n}"
