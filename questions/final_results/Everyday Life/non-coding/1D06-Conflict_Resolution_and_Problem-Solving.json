Alex has data on the type, frequency, participants, and resolution of these conflicts. Alex wants to present this data in a way that allows the school administration to understand the common causes of conflicts and most effective resolutions. Which formats could Alex use to present this data effectively?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Bar chart only\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Line graph only\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Pie chart and Line graph\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Bar chart and Pie chart\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"To display the frequency and type of conflicts, a bar chart may be the most effective way as it can clearly show the distribution of different conflict types. A pie chart can be used to represent the percentage of each conflict resolution method used, highlighting the most commonly used resolution method. A line graph isn't appropriate here as it is better suited for showing trends over time rather than categorical data.\"\n}"
