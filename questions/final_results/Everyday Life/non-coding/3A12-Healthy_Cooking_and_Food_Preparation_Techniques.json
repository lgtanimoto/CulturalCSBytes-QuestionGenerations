They want their program to be able to analyse a variety of foods, like vegetables, meat, or grains, and suggest the appropriate methods, such as steaming, baking, boiling, or grilling. The program should combine control structures, including nested loops and compound conditionals, to consider the type of food and its nutritional content, then output the healthiest cooking technique suitable for it. How might Alex's program be structured to accomplish this task?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"For every food group, apply a loop that executes the appropriate method based on nutritional content.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Use a single conditional statement for each food type and a loop for cooking methods.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Implement nested loops to iterate through each food group and evaluate each cooking method for each food item. Use compound conditionals to assign the healthiest technique based on nutrition content.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Assign a cooking method randomly to each food group.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"For this task, Alex will need nested loops to iterate over each food and evaluate how each cooking method influences their nutrition. Compound conditionals will then be used within the loop to determine the best method to retain or enhance a food's nutritional content.\"\n}"
