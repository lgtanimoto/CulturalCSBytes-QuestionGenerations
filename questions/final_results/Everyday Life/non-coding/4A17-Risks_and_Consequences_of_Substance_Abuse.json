They have written the following code snippets but are unsure how to organize it effectively. Can you help Alex decompose the problem into smaller manageable parts? List down the methods you think Alex can use based on the following program snippets: Heat levels, Timer, Eye blurriness enhancement, and Rule set for decision making.\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Just put all instructions in one main program without creating functions to encompass related tasks.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Make each effect (heat levels, timer, eye blurriness, decision making) its own function and call them within the main program.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"First program the rule set for decision making and then code everything else directly in the main program.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Only create separate functions for heat levels and timer. The eye blurriness enhancement and rule set for decision making can be coded in the main program.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"A program that complex can be much easier to understand, test, and maintain if it is broken down into functions or procedures, each with its own identifiable task. The effects (heat levels, timer, eye blurriness, decision making) mentioned here can each be made into unique functions. This would create a more readable and manageable code.\"\n}"
