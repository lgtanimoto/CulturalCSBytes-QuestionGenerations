They want a program to calculate the total cooking time for all the selected recipes. For this, Alex is thinking about creating a procedure with parameters to help with the task. Which of the following procedures would be the most appropriate to use in this situation?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Procedure CalculateCookingTime()\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Procedure CalculateCookingTime(recipeName)\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Procedure CalculateCookingTime(recipeName, numberOfGuests)\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Procedure CalculateCookingTime(int numberOfRecipesSelected, int averageMinutesPerRecipe)\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The most accurate way to calculate the total cooking time is to consider the number of selected recipes and their corresponding average cooking time per recipe. Hence, answer 4 - Procedure CalculateCookingTime(int numberOfRecipesSelected, int averageMinutesPerRecipe) - is an appropriate choice.\"\n}"
