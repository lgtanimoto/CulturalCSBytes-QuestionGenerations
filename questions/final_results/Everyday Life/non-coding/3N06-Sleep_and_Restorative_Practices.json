    "question_str": "{\n    \"Question\": \"Alex uses a fitness tracker for monitoring their sleep and restorative practices. They noticed that the tracker sends data to an app on their smartphone and then this data gets transferred to an online cloud service. Concerned about their data privacy, Alex decided to research how their sensitive data is protected during transmission. They find out that the data is encrypted during transmission. Which of the following options best describes the way that this kind of encryption works?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Data is shuffled randomly before sending and then reassembled on arrival.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Data is converted into a series of numbers which are sent and then converted back into the original data.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Data is translated into a secret code (cipher) that can only be translated back into the original data by a key. The ciphered data message is sent and then given the key when it arrives at the destination to decipher it back into the original data.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Data is hidden in another type of data (like an image or a song) and sent, then the intended recipient separates the original data from the other type of data.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Encryption is a method where information is translated into secret code that hides the information's true meaning. When this encrypted data is being transferred over a network, someone would need to have the correct decryption key in order to decrypt and access the original data. Despite the encrypted data potentially being intercepted during transmission, the intercepting party would be unable to understand the data without the decryption key.\"\n}"
