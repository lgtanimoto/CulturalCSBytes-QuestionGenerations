If the user cannot run any more miles after 10 consecutive days, the app should tell the user that they need to enter a higher daily miles number. Which code should Alex write?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Input milesPerDayCalculatetotalMiles = 0 counter = 0Repeat until totalMiles >= 100 totalMiles = totalMiles + milesPerDay counter = counter +1 if counter > 10return 'Please input a higher daily miles number.' end end Output 'It will take ' + counter + ' days to reach 100 miles.'\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Input milesPerDayCalculatetotalMiles = 0 counter = 1Repeat until totalMiles <= 100 totalMiles = totalMiles + milesPerDayif counter = 10 return 'Please input a higher daily miles number.' end counter = counter + 1 end Output 'It will take ' + counter + ' days to reach 100 miles.'\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Input milesPerDayCalculatetotalMiles = 0 counter = 0Repeat while totalMiles < 100 totalMiles = totalMiles + milesPerDayif counter = 10 end counter = counter + 1end Output 'It will take ' + counter + ' days to reach 100 miles.'\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Input milesPerDayCalculatetotalMiles = 0 counter = 0Repeat until totalMiles >= 100totalMiles = totalMiles + milesPerDaycounter = counter +1if counter > 10return 'Please input a higher daily miles number.' end end Output 'It will take ' + counter + ' days to reach 100 miles.'\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Alex's code should run a loop that adds milesPerDay to totalMiles until totalMiles hits or exceeds 100. But if the counter exceeds 10 (number of consecutive running days allowed), the program should stop and tell the user to input a higher daily miles number. Only then it outputs the number of days to reach 100 miles.\"\n}"
