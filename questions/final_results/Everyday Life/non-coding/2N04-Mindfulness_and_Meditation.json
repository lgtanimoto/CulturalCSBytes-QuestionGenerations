In the first session, Lennon's teacher will be leading the session from India and the meditation instruction will be live-streamed to Lennon and the other participants around the world.   When Lennon connects to the live stream, how will the meditation instruction be likely transmitted online from India to Lennon's computer?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"The meditation instruction is broadcast in one large data block from India to all participants simultaneously.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"The meditation instruction's data is broken down into smaller units or packets. Each packet is transmitted separately from India to Lennon and the other participants via multiple network devices and paths. When each packet reaches the participants, it is reassembled in the correct order to form the complete meditation instruction.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The meditation instruction is mailed on physical storage media from India to each participant.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"The meditation instruction is faxed to each participant's location.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The Internet transmits data in small units or packets using any number of paths between the source and destination. Upon reaching the destination, these packets are reassembled in the correct sequence to re-form the original data. This is how most data, including audio and video streams, are transmitted over the Internet.\"\n}"
