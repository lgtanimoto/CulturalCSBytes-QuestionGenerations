Alex has an idea for a feature that can automatically adjust the nutritional content based on portion sizes. Which of the following programming modifications will be most helpful to implement Alex's idea?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Add more RAM to Alex's laptop\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Create an AI model to predict cooking outcomes\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Add an automatic calculation function to the application\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Update the application's color scheme to be more appealing\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Adding an automatic calculation function to the application allows for the adjustment of the nutritional content based on portion sizes, which addresses the issue Alex identified. Other suggestions, like adding more RAM to the laptop or changing the color scheme of the application, would not address this specific problem.\"\n}"
