They recently find out about an option to input their health data\u2014like resting heart rate, blood pressure and glucose levels\u2014into the app to get more tailored training plans. However, they're worried about the safety of their health data. Which of the following statements is best for Alex to follow?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex should not be concerned about the security of the data. The app has a privacy policy that ensures the security of the data.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex should find out how the app secures data\u2014like if it's encrypted\u2014and what data is shared or sold to third parties. Alex may prefer not to use the feature if they determine the potential benefits don't outweigh the risks.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex should input their health data because the tailored training plans will outweigh any potential data security issues.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex should go ahead and input their health information. They can simply change their passwords regularly to keep their data secure.\",    \n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Although the app might offer enhanced features using that data, it's essential for Alex to ensure that their sensitive health information is protected sufficiently. Regular password changes won't necessarily protect against data breaches or irresponsible use of data by the company. Reading the app's privacy policy and asking critical questions about its data practices will help Alex make an informed decision.\"\n}"
