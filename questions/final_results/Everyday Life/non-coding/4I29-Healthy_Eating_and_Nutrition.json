What could be an outcome of these automated processes that may directly contradict Alex's expected privacy?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"The app will not have access to any other data on Alex's device, only those directly relevant to their diet and exercise habits.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"The app will only store data on Alex's device, and not on any external server.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The app could be collecting additional data not directly relevant to Alex's diet and exercise habits, without Alex's knowledge.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"The app will not be able to make any recommendations for Alex's diet or exercise habits as it cannot analyze the data it collects.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"While most apps provide privacy policies, these documents are often complex and difficult for users to fully understand. As a result, users, including Alex, may not be fully aware that some apps continue to collect user data even when not directly related to their primary function. This may result in users unknowingly giving permission for their data to be used for purposes such as advertising, or shared with third parties, both of which can be considered as privacy concerns.\"\n}"
