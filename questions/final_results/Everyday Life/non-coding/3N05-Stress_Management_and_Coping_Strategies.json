Thinking about the security measures in place, Alex compares the concept of defending a goal post against opposing soccer players with password-protected game accounts. How could Alex relate these concepts to help understand how physical and digital security measures protect electronic information?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"A sturdy goal post and a skilled goalie are equivalent to a strong password and a secure network.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"A goal post is a physical boundary, equivalent to a firewall, keeping unauthorized players out, while a strong password grants authorized access to the game account.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The soccer field's boundary markers represent the boundaries of a network, while the password protects from trespassers just as the goal post and skilled goalie protect from opposing players.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"A combination of all the above\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Both physical and digital security measures have the main goal of protecting valuable resources. In a soccer game, the goal post and the goalie represent physical security measures protecting a strategic point. Similarly, digital security measures like network boundaries (firewalls) and authorization methods (passwords) protect valuable electronic information.\"\n}"
