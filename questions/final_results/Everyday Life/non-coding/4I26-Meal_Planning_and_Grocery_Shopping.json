They want to create an algorithm to generate a shopping list based on the meals they plan to cook for the week. Which of the following options should Alex use?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex only needs to keep track of ingredients they use frequently and exclude the rest.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex should create an algorithm that takes a list of meals as input, extracts the ingredient list for each meal, merges the ingredient lists, and eliminates any duplicates before printing it out.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex should create an algorithm that randomly selects ingredients and then finds meals they can cook with them.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex should ask their friends for their shopping lists and merge them all together.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"An effective meal planning algorithm would take a list of meals as input, traverse through each of them, extract the ingredient lists and consolidate them while removing any duplicates. This would yield a comprehensive shopping list based on the planned meals, eliminating the chance of forgetting any items while shopping.\"\n}"
