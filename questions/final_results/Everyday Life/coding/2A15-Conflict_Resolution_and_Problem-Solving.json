If two classmates are having an argument, they can enter their issue and the bot gives advice based on keywords. Alex runs into an error where the bot only works for a singular keyword though it has been programmed to handle multiple. What is the most possible issue and how should Alex debug the program?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex must have made a mistake while coding the bot. They likely didn't input any keywords.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Perhaps Alex used 'elif' instead of 'if' in multiple conditions, thereby limiting the bot to only the first keyword it encounters. They should replace 'elif' with 'if' where needed.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The bot could be perfectly alright. Alex should check their input instead.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"There may be a syntax related error. Alex should check the indentation and colons.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The use of 'elif' might be limiting the program to respond on first identified keyword only. To ensure the bot checks every keyword, 'if' should be used instead of 'elif' after the first condition. This way, Alex's program will be able to handle multiple keywords.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action KeywordBot(text string)\\n    if text.Contains(\\\"money\\\")\\n        output \\\"Let's talk about monetary value\\\"\\n    elif text.Contains(\\\"deadline\\\")\\n        output \\\"We need to respect each other's time\\\"\\n    elif text.Contains(\\\"disrespect\\\")\\n        output \\\"Let's be more respectful\\\"\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
