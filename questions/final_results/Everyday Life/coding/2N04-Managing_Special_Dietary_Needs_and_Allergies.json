They decide to develop a digital system to handle, transmit and reassemble this important information across all departments efficiently. Alex's initial step involves breaking down the full customer information into smaller packets. Based on this new system, which of the following best describes how Alex should organize these smaller information packets?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Each packet should contain only a customer's name.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Each packet should contain a customer's name, their order,  their dietary needs and allergies.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Each packet should contain one aspect of a customer's detail, such as their name, their order, or their dietary needs.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Each packet should contain a random assortment of customer information, which will be sorted later by the system.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Breaking information into smaller pieces, or packets, helps manage and streamline data transmission. In Alex's scenario, each information packet should hold a distinct piece of customer information, such as their name, order, or dietary requirement. This allows for efficient transmission and precise reassembly of the data at the destination, ensuring each department receives the necessary information accurately.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"text name = \\\"Alex\\\"\\ntext order = \\\"Vegan Pizza\\\"\\ntext dietaryNeeds = \\\"Vegan, Allergic to nuts\\\"\\noutput name\\noutput order\\noutput dietaryNeeds\"\n}"
