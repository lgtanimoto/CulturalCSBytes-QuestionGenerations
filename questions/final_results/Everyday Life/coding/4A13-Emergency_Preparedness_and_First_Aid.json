The key function of the app utilizes an algorithm to find the nearest hospital from a list. The working code snippet is as follows: What can Alex comment to clearly explain the function of the code snippet?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"// The code takes a list of hospitals and finds the one with the best rating\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"// This calculates the distance between the user and the nearest grocery store\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"// The code calculates the distance between the user and each hospital, returning the nearest one\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"// This code snippet prints all hospitals in the list\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The function written fetches the location of the user and each hospital, computes the distance between the user and each of them, and finally returns the nearest hospital. Therefore, Alex should add a comment stating that the code calculates the distance between the user and each hospital, returning the nearest one.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action FindNearestHospital(useful data hospitals, user's location) \\n   minimum distance = infinity \\n   for each hospital in hospitals \\n      if distance(user's location, hospital's location) < minimum distance \\n         minimum distance = distance(user's location, hospital's location) \\n         nearest hospital = hospital \\n      end \\n   end \\n   return nearest hospital's contact \\nend\"\n}"
