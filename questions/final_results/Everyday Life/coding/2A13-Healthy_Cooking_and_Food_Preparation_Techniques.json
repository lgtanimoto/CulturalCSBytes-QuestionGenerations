Here is a simple version of Alex's code: Based on the code snippet, what would be a good test case to run to ensure that the app is suggesting appropriate cooking methods for different food items?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"CookingMethods('fruits')\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"CookingMethods('water')\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"CookingMethods('meat')\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"CookingMethods('candy')\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The test case using 'meat' as an input will adequately test the app's ability to suggest appropriate cooking methods. Alex's program doesn't currently have a branch for 'fruits', 'water', or 'candy', and so calling the function with these items as parameters won't verify the system's expected behavior.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action CookingMethods(text Food)\\n    if Food = \\\"vegetables\\\"\\n        output \\\"Steaming and Stir Fry.\\\"\\n    elseif Food = \\\"meat\\\"\\n        output \\\"Grilling, baking and broiling.\\\"\\n    else\\n        output \\\"Could not locate food item.
