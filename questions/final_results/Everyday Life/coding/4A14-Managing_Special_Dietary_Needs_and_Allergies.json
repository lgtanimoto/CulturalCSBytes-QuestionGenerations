Alex is working on a program to catalog this information. They have created two lists, one to hold the list of patients and another to hold the list of dietary needs for each patient. The program needs to be able to add new patients and their dietary needs to the list, as well as search for a patient to view their dietary needs. Here is an incomplete program. Which lines of code will help complete Alex's program?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"On line 9 add following code: dietary_needs[pIndex] = diet\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"On line 9 add following code: patient[pIndex] = diet\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"On line 16 add following code: return dietary_needs[pIndex]\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"On line 16 add following code: return patient[pIndex]\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In line 9, Alex should store the diet requirement in the dietary_needs list, not in the patient list. So the correct piece of code is 'dietary_needs[pIndex] = diet'. Similarly, in line 16, Alex should return the corresponding diet requirement from the dietary_needs list for a given patient. So the correct piece of code is 'return dietary_needs[pIndex]'.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"List<text> patient\\nList<text> dietary_needs\\n\\naction addPatient(text name, text diet)\\n    integer pIndex = patient:Add(name)\\n    //<<missing code>>\\nend\\n\\naction getDiet(text name) returns text\\n    integer pIndex = patient:FindFirst(name)\\n    if pIndex >= 0\\n        //<<missing code>>\\n    end\\n    return \\\"\\\"\\nend\"\n}"
