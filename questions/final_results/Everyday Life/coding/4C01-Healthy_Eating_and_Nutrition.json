In designing this application, Alex decides to use abstractions for several tasks, including 'CalculateCalories', 'AddFoodItem', and 'DisplayNutritionReport'. Which of the following represents the best use of abstraction?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex writes detailed methods to calculate the caloric value and nutritional content of each individual food type.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex has separate 'CalculateCalories' procedures for different meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex creates a universal method to 'CalculateCalories' that can be applied to any food item entered into the system.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex builds a separate application to process and analyse the user's food photo instead of writing a code to identify food items.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Abstraction is the process of hiding the complexity of the complete system and exposing only the necessary parts. In this case, a universal 'CalculateCalories' function is a perfect example of abstraction, as it allows Alex to handle any kind of food input without specifying the calculation for each individual food type.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"class Food\\n\\n    action CalculateCalories(FoodItem item)\\n        integer calories = item.GetCaloricValue()\\n        return calories\\n    end\\n\\n    action AddFoodItem(FoodItem item)\\n        // TODO: Add code to add item to list of consumed foods\\n    end\\n\\n    action DisplayNutritionReport()\\n        // TODO: Write code to calculate total nutrition report based on consumed foods list\\n    end\\n\\nend\\n\\n\"\n}"
