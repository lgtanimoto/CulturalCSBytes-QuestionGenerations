Alex's program has an array of air samples taken every hour for a week.

If an 'unhealthy' reading is detected, it will trigger an event that sends a notification to the user. This will continue to occur every hour as long as the air quality remains 'unhealthy'.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"integer i = 0\\nwhile i < length of airSamples\\n    if airSamples[i] == 'unhealthy'\\n        output 'The air quality is currently unhealthy.
