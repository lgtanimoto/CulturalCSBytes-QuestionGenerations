The software takes as input details about the different parts of the building, breaks them down into smaller packets, transfers those packets over a network, and re-assembles the information at the destination. What is the best description for what Alex's software does?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex's software models buildings and networks but does not transfer any information.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex's software breaks down, transmits, and re-assembles data about building parts over the internet.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex's software only re-assembles packets of information on the destination device.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex's software only breaks down details about the different parts of the building.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Alex's software takes in details about the building, breaks them down into smaller pieces (packets), transfers them over a network, and re-assembles the information at the destination. This process is similar to how data is transferred over the internet.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"Class BuildingPart \\n Text name \\n number sizeKB \\n \\n end \\n \\n action Main \\n BuildingPart part1 \\n part1:name = \\\"Kitchen\\\" \\n part1:sizeKB = 200 \\n output \\\"Transferring \\\" + part1:name + \\\"!\\\" \\n // Here would go the code for breaking down, transferring and reassembling the data \\n end \"\n}"
