'1011' in binary translates to 1*2^0 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^3 = 1 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 11 in decimal format.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"text signal = \\\"1011\\\"\\ninteger equivalentDecimal = 0\\ninteger length = signal:GetLength()\\nfor i = 0 to length - 1\\n    integer bit = signal:GetSubstring(length - 1 - i, 1)\\n    if bit = 1\\n        equivalentDecimal = equivalentDecimal + 2^i\\n    end\\nend\\noutput equivalentDecimal\"\n}"
