They have decided to use a Bar Chart for better visualization. Alex's teammates have written a code snippet to implement the Chart. However, they need your help to figure out what will be the visual representation for the data after executing the code. The bar chart is measured in hours: 'Sand':2.5, 'Grass':4, 'Concrete':6. What will the Bar chart look like after executing the code?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"The x-axis has labels 'Sand', 'Grass', 'Concrete' and the bar heights correspond to 2.5, 4, 6 respectively.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"The x-axis has labels 'Sand', 'Grass', 'Concrete' and the bar heights correspond to 6, 4, 2.5 respectively.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The x-axis has labels 'Concrete', 'Grass', 'Sand' and the bar heights correspond to 2.5, 4, 6 respectively.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"The x-axis has labels 'Concrete', 'Grass', 'Sand' and the bar heights correspond to 6, 4, 2.5 respectively.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The bar chart X-axis will contain the labels in the order 'Sand', 'Grass', 'Concrete' because that's the order the data was inserted into the chart. The corresponding bar heights would be 2.5, 4, 6 respectively, as those are the battery hours on each terrain.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"data.Add(\\\"Sand\\\", 2.5)\\ndata.Add(\\\"Grass\\\", 4)\\ndata.Add(\\\"Concrete\\\", 6)\\nChart chart\\nchart.Add(data)\\nchart.SetTitle(\\\"Robot's Battery Life on Different Terrains\\\")\\nchart.SetXTitle(\\\"Terrains\\\")\\nchart.SetYTitle(\\\"Battery Life (hours)\\\")\\nchart.Draw()\"\n}"
