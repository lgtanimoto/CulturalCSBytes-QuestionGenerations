They are creating a function that calculates the gravitational, electric, and magnetic forces. They currently have a code that calculates these values individually. Given the coding scenario, can you suggest what Alex should do next to enhance their code?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex should repeat the code three times, once for each force.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex should create a loop to calculate the forces.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex should create a function to calculate each force and then call these functions within their main program.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex should remove any functions and put all the code on the main line of the program.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Alex's next step should be to create individual functions to calculate each of the forces. This will allow them to call these functions whenever they need to estimate one of the forces, rather than having repeated code. This step follows the programming development strategy of decomposing problems into smaller sub-problems and enhancing the program's readability and maintainability.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action CalculateGravitationalForce(number mass1, number mass2, number distance)\\n    // Code to calculate gravitational force\\nend\\n\\naction CalculateElectricForce(number charge1, number charge2, number distance)\\n    // Code to calculate electric force\\nend\\n\\naction CalculateMagneticForce(number charge, number velocity, number magneticField)\\n    // Code to calculate magnetic force\\nend\"\n}"
