Each generation is modeled as a iteration in a loop, and the genetic traits of individuals are stored as character strings. However, the feedback from users indicates that the current random generation of traits is too uniform and lacks the biological realism. How can Alex modify their program to better represent natural genetic inheritance in the next iteration of development?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex can enhance the data representation to include dominant and recessive traits.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex should include environmental factors to influence the genetics.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex should use a more randomized process for generating traits.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex could include genetic mutation in the model to add variation and unpredictability.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In biological reality, traits aren't passed down perfectly or randomly from generation to generation. Many traits are dominated by others, this means that if an organism has two different versions of a gene, one may be expressed over the other. Alex could improve the realism of the program by encoding this phenomenon of dominant and recessive traits to their genetic model.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"repeat 10 times\\n   text trait1 = GenerateRandomTrait()\\n   text trait2 = GenerateRandomTrait()\\n   output \\\"Generation: \\\" + (repeatIndex + 1) + \\\" Trait1: \\\" + trait1 + \\\" Trait2: \\\" + trait2\\nend\\n\\naction GenerateRandomTrait()\\n    integer r = random(2)\\n    if r == 1\\n        return \\\"Trait1\\\"\\n    else\\n        return \\\"Trait2\\\"\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
