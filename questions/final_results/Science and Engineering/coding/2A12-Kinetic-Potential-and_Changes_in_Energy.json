Alex found an existing code that calculates kinetic energy. To demonstrate changes in energy, Alex decided to modify the existing program to add a feature that calculates potential energy. Given the formula for potential energy (mgh, where m = mass, g = gravity and h = height), which of the following code snippets achieves that new functionality?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"action CalculateEnergy(integer m, number v, number g, number h) returns number\\n    number KE = 0.5 * m * v * v\\n    number PE = m * g * h\\n    return KE + PE\\nend\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"action CalculateEnergy(integer m, number v) returns number\\n    number KE = 0.5 * m * v * v\\n    return KE\\nend\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"action CalculateEnergy(integer m, number v, number g) returns number\\n    number KE = 0.5 * m * v * v\\n    return KE\\nend\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"action CalculateEnergy(integer m, number v, number g, number h) returns number\\n    number KE = 0.5 * m * v * v\\n    return KE\\nend\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Alex correctly modified the existing code. They added potential energy calculation and combined both kinetic and potential energy in the return statement. This ensures the program now calculates and returns the sum of both the kinetic and potential energy, demonstrating an energy changes.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action CalculateEnergy(integer m, number v) returns number\\n    number KE = 0.5 * m * v * v\\n    return KE\\nend\"\n}"
