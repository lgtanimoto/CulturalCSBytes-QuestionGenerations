However, they face some difficulty in comprehending the code. The code looks something like this:Which of the following statements best describes how the formula (final_speed = initial_speed + acceleration * time) implemented here works?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"The formula adds the product of the acceleration and time, to the initial speed to calculate the final speed.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"The formula substracts the product of the acceleration and time, from the initial speed to obtain the final speed.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The formula multiplies the acceleration with time, and ignores the initial speed to get the final speed.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"None of the above.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The code correctly implements the physics formula for final speed (final_speed = initial_speed + acceleration * time). The formula basically says that the final speed of an object is calculated by adding the product of the acceleration and time to the initial speed.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action finalSpeed(integer initial_speed, integer acceleration, integer time) returns integer\\n    number final_speed = initial_speed + acceleration * time\\n    return final_speed\\nend\"\n}"
