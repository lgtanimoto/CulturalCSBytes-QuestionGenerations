They've developed an algorithm based on data collected over past years to predict future weather trends. An inspector who's interested in the logic behind the algorithm is expected to visit. The code for Alex's procedure is as follows:In the absence of Alex, how can the inspector gain a decent understanding of the algorithm? \",\n    \"Answer1\": \"By reading the program code\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"By reading the user guide of the program\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"By looking at Alex's documentation where they explains their design decisions, logic, and methodology in great detail\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"By running the program and testing it with variety of inputs\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Detailed documentation is the key when it comes to understanding the inner workings of a complex program. In Alex's documentation, design decisions, algorithms, and methods used for the development of the program are explained which would give the inspector a good understanding of it.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action weatherPrediction(number temp)\\n    number summerAvg = 30.0\\n    number winterAvg = 10.0\\n    if temp < winterAvg\\n        output \\\"Expect colder weather\\\"\\n    elseif temp > summerAvg\\n        output \\\"Expect warmer weather\\\"\\n    else\\n        output \\\"Weather is moderating\\\"\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
