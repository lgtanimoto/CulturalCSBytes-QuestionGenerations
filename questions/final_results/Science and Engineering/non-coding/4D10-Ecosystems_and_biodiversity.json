They have two options on how to organize the data: in a 2D grid where each cell represents a different species or in a 3D model where the X-axis represents one ecosystem, the Y-axis represents another ecosystem, and the Z-axis represents different species. What might be a tradeoff Alex should consider when deciding how to store and organize their data?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"A 2D grid is simple to understand and work with, but it may limit the number of ecosystems Alex can represent.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"A 3D model can represent more information, but it may be harder to visualize.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"A 3D model is easier to work with because it can store more data.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"A 2D grid is always better because it is simpler.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Option 1 is correct. A 2D grid representation is easier to understand and work with but could limit the number of ecosystems that Alex can represent, whereas a 3D model can store more information but may be complicated and harder to visualize and interpret.\"\n}"
