Some users have noticed that the generated floor plans don't always accommodate for those with diverse physical needs and abilities. Alex's friend Leila uses a wheelchair and has shared with him that while ramp access was systematically included, not all interior doorways were wide enough for her wheelchair to pass through. How can Alex refine his program?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex doesn\u2019t need to change anything because the program is designed to accommodate the majority of users.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex can disregard this feedback because Leila is his friend and he doesn\u2019t want a bias in his programming due to personal relationships.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex can include an option for users to specify their needs. However, he can decide whether he wants to implement these modifications or not.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex can expand the user criteria to include diverse physical needs such as wheelchair accessibility and ensure that this is implemented in all aspects of the floor plan, including interior doorways.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Inclusive design should be a priority in any creation, computational or otherwise. Alex can use the data and user feedback provided to optimize his program for equitable usability and accessibility, reducing bias and equity deficits in the process.\"\n}"
