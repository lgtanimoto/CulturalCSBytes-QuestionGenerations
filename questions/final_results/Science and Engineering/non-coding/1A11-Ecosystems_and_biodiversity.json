Each list contains species names and the number of times that species was observed in the ecosystem. Alex needs to write code to find out how many species are unique to each ecosystem and which species are found in both. What are the sequence of steps Alex should take to accomplish this?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"1. Create a loop to go through the first list. 2. Within this loop, create another loop to search the second list. 3. Create a condition to test whether a species is unique to the first list or is found in both lists.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"1. Compare the first element of the first list to the first element of the second list. 2. If they are the same, mark the species as found in both ecosystems and move to the next element.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"1. Merge the two lists. 2. Go through the combined list and count each unique species. 3. Deduct the species found in both lists from the total count number.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"1. Go through each list independently and count each unique species. 2. Add the two resultant numbers together to get the total number of unique species.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The correct procedure is to loop through each element of the first list and then loop through all the elements of the second list for each element from the first list. This way each species from the first list is effectively compared against all the species of the second list to ascertain if it is unique to the first or is also found in the second.\"\n}"
