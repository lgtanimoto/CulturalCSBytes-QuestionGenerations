To safely store the data, Alex's teacher has advised them to use a combination of physical and digital security measures. What might this advice entail?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Storing the data on a USB and hiding the USB in a sock drawer\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Saving the data on Alex's personal computer and password-protecting the file\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Uploading the data to a cloud server with encrypted access and keeping the encryption key in a secure location\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Sharing the data on a public forum for peer review and criticism\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Both physical and digital security measures are necessary to protect electronic information. Uploading the data to a cloud server with encrypted access is a digital security measure, and keeping the encryption key in a secure location is a physical security measure. This combination ensures the data is not easily accessible by unauthorized users, thus protecting the integrity and confidentiality of the information.\"\n}"
