If Alex's computer suddenly shuts down due to issues with its power supply, what is the most likely effect on the computer's system and data?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Nothing, as the computer will operate normally once power is restored\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Unsaved data will be lost, but saved data and the operating system will remain unaffected\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Both saved and unsaved data will be lost, but the operating system will remain unaffected\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Both the operating system and all data will be affected\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Any unsaved data will be lost as it is stored in RAM, which is volatile memory that requires a power source to maintain the data it holds. When a computer loses power abruptly, the data in RAM disappears. However, saved data, which is stored on non-volatile storage devices like hard drives and SSDs, remains safe, and the operating system will not be affected as it is also stored in non-volatile memory.\"\n}"
