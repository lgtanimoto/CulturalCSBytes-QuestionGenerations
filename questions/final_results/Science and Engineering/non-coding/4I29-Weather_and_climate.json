Alex has gathered loads of weather data over several years, including information about temperature, wind speed, humidity, and precipitation. Alex was pleasantly surprised to discover a website that allows them to upload his data, and in return, the website generates detailed climate graphs that help Alex understand long-term climate trends in the area. However, Alex is concerned because he also realizes that the location data attached to the datasets could be used to determine exactly where he lives. Which of the following is a correct interpretation of Alex's privacy concern?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex is rightfully concerned; the website could potentially use the location data to find out exactly where Alex lives without their knowledge.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex shouldn't be worried because the website only intends to use the data for weather-related purposes, and they wouldn\u2019t use the location data in any other way.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex shouldn't be concerned because the website can\u2019t determine his exact location from the weather data alone.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex is unnecessarily worried; the use of location data for generating weather trend reports doesn't give out his exact location data.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Alex's concern is valid. Even though the website's immediate purpose is to generate climate graphs, location data could potentially be used to determine Alex's exact location, and this might not be made explicitly clear to users like Alex.\"\n}"
