    "question_str": "{\n    \"Question\": \"Alex is working on a Physics simulation software for their high school science project. The program needs to calculate the gravitational, electric, and magnetic forces between two objects when the user inputs their masses, charges, and distances.. Alex wants to code a solution that considers different user preferences and can be improved over time. Which one of the following plans most closely aligns with Alex's goal? \",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex will write the code, get it working for one scenario and then submit the project.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex will ask a few friends to try out their program after every major update. Alex will use their feedback to make improvements.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex will first design a user-friendly interface, then add functionality for each of the three forces one at a time, testing each one thoroughly before moving on to the next. Alex will ask classmates to test the program.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex will code the solutions for all three forces first. Then they will add an option for users to choose their preferred units of measurement.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The iterative programming process involves creating small parts of a larger program and testing these parts individually before integrating them into the larger program. In this case, Alex is using an iterative process to complete each force calculation and test it individually before moving to the next, allowing for steady progression and thorough testing. Also, by seeking the perspectives of multiple colleagues, they are considering user preference in their design.\"\n}"
