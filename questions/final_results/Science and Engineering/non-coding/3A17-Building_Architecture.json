Alex wants to ensure their program works as expected and catches any potential problems before implementing on the real site. Which one of the following test cases would NOT be a useful test of Alex's program?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Setting the materials' strengths to the maximum possible values on the whole structure and verifying that it stands and performs as expected\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Simulating a case where the building is built with the wrong type of material to see how the program reacts and whether it issues a warning\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Running a simulation with average mass and strength values for all the materials\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Testing if the program prints out a recipe for cooking spaghetti\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Even though it is essential to design a variety of test cases, the spaghetti recipe doesn't relate to the building architecture, and it would not provide useful or meaningful information on the program's performance or potential bugs.\"\n}"
