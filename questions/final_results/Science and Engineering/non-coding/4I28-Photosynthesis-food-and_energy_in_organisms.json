    "question_str": "{\n    \"Question\": \"Alex is fascinated by the process of photosynthesis and the energy transfer that occurs in organisms. They come across an article about a company that has patented a technique that artificially replicates the photosynthesis process on a large scale for energy production. While reading further, Alex starts contemplating the social and economic implications of such patent. Which of the following statements could be a potential outcome due to the patented photosynthesis process?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"The innovation could lead to a major breakthrough in green energy sources, thus encouraging the growth of sustainable and environmentally-friendly energy options.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"The company who holds the patent could charge unaffordable prices for the use of the technique, thereby limiting its application to only those who can afford it.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Other companies and researchers, due to this patent, might hesitate in developing similar or advanced techniques.\", \n    \"Answer4\": \"All of the above are potential outcomes.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Intellectual property laws, while protecting and encouraging innovation, can also lead to monopolization and stifle further innovation. In this scenario, the company holding the patent may limit the use of the technique through high costs, thereby preventing wide-scale implementation of the technique. At the same time, the patented method represents a major advancement in the quest for sustainable energy. Therefore, the consequences of such patents can be both beneficial and harmful.\"\n}"
