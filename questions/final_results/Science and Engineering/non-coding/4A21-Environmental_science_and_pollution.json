The application calculates emissions based on mileage, car type, or type of public transportation used. However, some users find the application difficult to use due to complex terms and calculations. Alex decides to refine the application to make it more accessible. What can Alex do to achieve this?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex can add a detailed technical manual explaining the formulas and chemical mechanisms of carbon emissions.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex can try to simplify the terminology and provide real-world examples equating specific amounts of CO2 emissions to everyday situations.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex can remove the carbon emission feature as it seems too complex for users.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex can enhance the application's visualizations, adding more graphs and charts to represent carbon emissions.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Although all the suggested improvements could have an impact, the best way to make the application more accessible is to simplify complex terminologies and provide real-world examples, making it easier for a wider audience to understand. Detailed technical manuals may only confuse non-technical users and removing the feature altogether defeats the purpose of the app. Visual enhancements can be complementary, but they won't necessarily help to decipher complex terms or calculations.\",\n    \"chart_content\": \"No charts or graphics are referenced in the question.\"\n}"
