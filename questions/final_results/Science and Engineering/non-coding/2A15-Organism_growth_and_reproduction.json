    "question_str": "{\n    \"Question\": \"Alex is writing an algorithm to simulate the growth and reproduction of an organism in a closed ecosystem over a period of one year. The organism has a growth period during which it doubles its size and a reproduction period during which it produces two offspring. Alex has written the following pseudocode: \\n\\nInitialize size = 1 and offspring = 0\\nFor each day of the year: \\n If day < 183 (half the year), then size = size * 2\\n Else offspring = offspring + 2\\n\\nHowever, when Alex runs their simulation, they find that the number of offspring produced is half of what they expect. Which of the following changes could solve the issue?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Change the condition to 'If day <= 183', to include the 183rd day in the growth period.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Change the code inside the 'else' clause to 'offspring = offspring + 4', to double the reproduction rate.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Change the initialization of offspring to 'offspring = 2', to start with two offspring.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Increase the number of days in the year to 364 in the pseudocode to include an extra day for reproduction.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"As the issue lies with the number of offspring produced being halved, the algorithm needs to ensure that offspring are being produced on the correct number of days. By changing the condition to 'If day <= 183', the 183rd day would be included in the growth part of the year, thus allowing for reproduction on more days.\"\n}"
