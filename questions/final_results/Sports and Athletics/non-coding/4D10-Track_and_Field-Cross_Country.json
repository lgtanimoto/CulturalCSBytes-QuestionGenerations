Alex wants to include an array list of this week's running distances in miles and an array of how long it took in minutes. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of the data storage solutions in this context.\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Array lists and arrays both store and organize data in an efficient manner, but arrays are static and cannot hold data types.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Although an array offers faster access time, it is not dynamic. Array lists are dynamic in size but offer less efficient access.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Arrays are dynamic and can hold multiple data types, while array lists are static and cannot hold multiple data types.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Array lists can hold more than one data type and have a dynamic size, but have longer access times. Arrays have quicker access times but are fixed in size and can only hold one data type.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In this scenario, while an array could be more time efficient, an array list might be more beneficial for Alex because the team's running distances could vary each week. The array list's ability to dynamically resize could accommodate these varying amounts of data, albeit with a slightly slower access time. An array, on the other hand, is fixed in size and can only hold one data type, but has quicker access times.\"\n}"
