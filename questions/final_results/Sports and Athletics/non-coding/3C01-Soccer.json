They noticed that their teammates often have difficulty tracking their individual stats during a match. Considering the constraints of a soccer game and the needs of their teammates, what device modification would be most suitable for tracking in-game stats?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"A wearable device like a smartwatch that records stats\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"A computing device on the sidelines to manually input data\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"A mobile app that requires players to input their own data\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"An implantable device to record data\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Given the physical nature of a soccer match, a wearable device like a smartwatch would be the most suitable for tracking in-game stats. This would allow continuous, hands-free data collection, which would ensure minimal disruption to the players during the match. Other options, such as manual data entry on the sidelines or requiring players to input their own data, would be less feasible due to the ongoing match. An implantable device, while theoretically possible, raises significant ethical, safety, and regulatory issues.\"\n}"
