They've set a goal to eventually lift 75 pounds. In which week will Alex reach their weightlifting goal?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Week 14\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Week 7\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Week 10\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Week 13\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"This is a simple looping problem. Starting at 10 pounds, Alex will add 5 pounds per week. So, 10 (for week 1) + 5*13 (for the next 13 weeks) = 75 pounds, which Alex will reach during the 14th week.\"\n}"
