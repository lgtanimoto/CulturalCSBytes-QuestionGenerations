    "question_str": "{\n    \"Question\": \"Alex is playing an online real-time strategy game with their friends from different parts of the country. They notice that sometimes, their commands to their game pieces are not executed immediately. As a student studying both computer science and psychology, this delay reminds them of the way a human brain may need time to process complex tasks. Alex imagines this delay could be due to how information is transmitted over the internet. How might this be happening in terms of information transmission?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Each command that Alex inputs is being sent as one large packet directly to the game server.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex's commands are first screened by their local internet provider before being sent to the game server.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Each command from Alex is divided into smaller packets, transmitted through various network devices, reassembled at the game server, and then executed.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex's internet connectivity has no impact on this delay; it's fully reliant on the game's internal processing.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Information is segmented into smaller packets before being transmitted over the internet. These packets are relayed through various network devices and then reassembled at the destination, in this case, the game server. This process could result in a slight delay, which Alex notices as a lag between their command and the response in the game.\"\n}"
