The team wants to make their routine more inclusive and diverse by adding elements of Indian classical dance.  Alex contacts their friend Sasha, who is an expert in Indian classical dance, for help. What tools or methods should Alex use to effectively collaborate with Sasha on this project despite their different fields of expertise and cultural backgrounds?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex should visit a library and research on Indian Classical dance and then incorporate it into the routine on their own.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex should disregard Sasha\u2019s expertise and assume they know best about the cheer routine.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex should use online collaborative tools such as Google docs to share their routine ideas, and video call platforms like Zoom to discuss and work synchronously on the routine with Sasha.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex should simply ask Sasha to perform in their routine to make it 'diverse'.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Using online collaboration tools and video call platforms allows Alex to effectively work with Sasha despite their different expertise, and helps them create an inclusive cheer routine that respects and reflects Sasha's cultural expertise in Indian classical dance. In this way, the concepts from Indian Classical dance can be properly integrated into cheerleading and not merely used as a prop or performance.\"\n}"
