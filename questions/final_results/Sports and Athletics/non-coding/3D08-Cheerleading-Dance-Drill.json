They decided to make use of a computational tool to make data collection, storage, and analysis easier. Given that the heights of members range from 5 feet to 6 feet 2 inches, with measurements given in inches, their cheerleading captain asked them to transform the data into feet for a more meaningful comparison. Which of the following scripts best takes Alex's measured data and converts it into feet?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"for each height in 'height_data'inches_divided = height_data(height)//12feet_and_inches = inches_divided + '\\\" ' + height_data(height)%12 + '\\\" '\\\"append feet_and_inches to converted_dataend\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"for each height in 'height_data'height_in_feet = height_data(height)/12append height_in_feet to converted_dataend\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"for each height in 'height_data'inches_remaining = height_data(height)%12height_in_feet = (height_data(height) - inches_remaining) / 12append height_in_feet to converted_dataend\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"for each height in 'height_data'divide_by_twelve = height_data(height) * .08333append divide_by_twelve to converted_dataend\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Alex's script should convert the height from inches to feet and inches to provide more meaningful data. Answer 1 correctly translates the height in inches first into a whole number of feet using integer division (//) and then calculates the remaining inches with the modulo operation (%). The results are combined into a string that represents the height in feet and inches.\"\n}"
