They wrote a program to track when each team member served and scored a point. So far, they have written code to calculate all the points scored, but now they want to adapt the code to figure out which team member has scored the most. The program is shown below:How could Alex modify the 'FindTopScorer' procedure to find the team member that scored the most points?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Change the 'if' statement to test if 'ScoreCount[i] > maxScore'\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Change the 'while' loop to a 'for' loop\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Change the 'maxScore' initialization to be 0 instead of -9999\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Change 'ScoreCount[i]' to 'ScoreCount[i+1]'\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Initially, maxScore is set to an absurdly low number to ensure that any score will be higher. The 'if' condition currently checks if the score is less than maxScore. However, it should rather be checking if it is greater to correctly identify the maximum score. The rest of the code will then correctly identify the player with the maximum score, so Answer 1 is the correct option.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"number[] ScoreCount\\nstring[] TeamMembers\\n\\naction FindTopScorer()\\n    number maxScore = -9999\\n    integer topScorerIndex = -1\\n    integer i = 0\\n    while i < ScoreCount:GetSize()\\n        if ScoreCount[i] < maxScore\\n            maxScore = ScoreCount[i]\\n            topScorerIndex = i\\n        end\\n        i = i + 1\\n    end\\n    output \\\"Top Scorer is \\\" + TeamMembers[topScorerIndex]\\nend\"\n}"
