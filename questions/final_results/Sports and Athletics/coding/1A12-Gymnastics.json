    "question_str": "{\n    \"Question\": \"Alex aspires to be a gymnast. To monitor their progress, they decided to create a program that breaks down their training routine into smaller tasks. Alex's daily routine includes warm-up, skill training, strength and conditioning, and cool down. Each task begins only after the previous one is completed. Depending on their daily performance, Alex changes their strength and conditioning duration. What does the following program output if Alex performed exceedingly well today?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Warm-up: 20 minutes\\nSkill Training: 50 minutes\\nStrength and Conditioning: 40 minutes\\nCool down: 15 minutes\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Warm-up: 20 minutes\\nSkill Training: 50 minutes\\nStrength and Conditioning: 60 minutes\\nCool down: 15 minutes\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Warm-up: 20 minutes\\nSkill Training: 50 minutes\\nStrength and Conditioning: 30 minutes\\nCool down: 15 minutes\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Warm-up: 20 minutes\\nSkill Training: 50 minutes\\nStrength and Conditioning: 30 minutes\\nCool down: 10 minutes\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Alex's training plan has a built-in conditional. If their performance was exceedingly well today, the strength and conditioning phase duration is increased by 20 minutes, making the total strength and conditioning time 60 minutes.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"integer performance = 8\\ninteger strengthDuration = 40\\n\\n// program proceeds to the next task only after the previous one is complete\\noutput \\\"Warm-up: 20 minutes\\\"\\noutput \\\"Skill Training: 50 minutes\\\"\\n\\n// If Alex performs really well, increase strength and conditioning duration\\nif performance > 7\\n    strengthDuration = strengthDuration + 20\\nend\\n\\noutput \\\"Strength and Conditioning: \\\" + strengthDuration + \\\" minutes\\\"\\noutput \\\"Cool down: 15 minutes\\\"\"\n}"
