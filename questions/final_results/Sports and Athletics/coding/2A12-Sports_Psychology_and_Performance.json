Alex wants to include a feature that calculates the athlete's 'hot-streaks' - a series of games where the athlete performs significantly above their average. The current code fails to identify these 'hot-streaks'. Which of the following changes should Alex make to effectively identify the 'hot-streaks'?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Replace the '<' operator with the '>' operator in line 5\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Replace the 'average' variable with the 'performance' variable in line 3\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Replace the 'average' variable with the 'performance' variable in line 6\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Replace the 'performance' variable with the 'average' variable in line 4\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"A hot-streak is a period where the athlete performs better than usual. Therefore, the condition in line 5 should be 'if performance > average' instead of 'if performance < average'. This modification will allow the code to accurately identify the athlete's 'hot-streaks'.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"number average = calculateAveragePerformance()\\nrepeat with each number performance in previousGames\\n    if performance < average\\n        output performance\\n    else\\n        output 'Hot-streak'\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
