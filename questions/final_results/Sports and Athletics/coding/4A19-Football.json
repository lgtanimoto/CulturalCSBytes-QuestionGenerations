Their code initially summed up all yardage without differentiating between teams. However, feedback from users revealed that they would prefer yardage for each team individually. Users also want a message if no yards were gained at all. What modifications should Alex make to cater to the users' needs?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Split the yardage calculation into two segments, each for a team, and add a conditional clause to output a message if total yardage equals zero.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Remove the yardage calculation entirely as it seems to be confusing the users.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"No changes are required as long as the calculation is accurate.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Add more team details to distract the users from the yardage calculation.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Alex needs to incorporate the feedback from the users. They can achieve this by segregating the calculation of yardage for each team. Additionally, a conditional clause should be added to check if the total yardage is zero, in which case a suitable message should be displayed.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"integer teamAYardage = 0\\ninteger teamBYardage = 0\\nwhile hasMorePlays()\\n    Play currentPlay = getNextPlay()\\n    if currentPlay.team == 'A'\\n        teamAYardage = teamAYardage + currentPlay.yardage\\n    else if currentPlay.team == 'B'\\n        teamBYardage = teamBYardage + currentPlay.yardage\\n    end\\nend\\n\\nif teamAYardage + teamBYardage == 0\\n    output \\\"No yards were gained in this match.\\\"\\nelse\\n    output \\\"Team A gained \\\" + teamAYardage + \\\" yards.\\\"\\n    output \\\"Team B gained \\\" + teamBYardage + \\\" yards.\\\"\\nend\"\n}"
