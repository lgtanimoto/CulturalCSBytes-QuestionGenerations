The code for Alex's procedure is as shown below. However, Alex notices that the code isn't functioning as expected. How should Alex decompose the problem to make the correct sequence of instructions for counting unsuccessful catches?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"They should increment the total catches every time and increment unsuccessful catches when the catch is not successful.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"They should increment unsuccessful catches every time and total catches when the catch is successful.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"They should increment unsuccessful catches only when the catch is not successful.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"They should increment total catches only when the catch is successful.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Alex should increment the total number of catches each time a catch is attempted, regardless of whether it is successful or not. The count of unsuccessful catches should only be incremented when a catch is recorded as not successful. This way, the program correctly counts total and unsuccessful catches.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"integer totalCatches = 0\\ninteger unsuccessfulCatches = 0\\n\\naction recordCatch(boolean isSuccessful)\\n    totalCatches = totalCatches + 1\\n    if isSuccessful == false\\n        unsuccessfulCatches = unsuccessfulCatches + 1\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
