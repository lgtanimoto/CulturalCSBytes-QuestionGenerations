This, in turn, simplifies their code and makes it more efficient. While loops and for loops would only work temporarily, and would require more code, and switch cases wouldn't allow for counting reps.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"integer[5] Lifts\\nLifts[0] = 10\\nLifts[1] = 12\\nLifts[2] = 15\\nLifts[3] = 8\\nLifts[4] = 20\\nfor each item in Lifts\\n    output item\\nend\"\n}"
