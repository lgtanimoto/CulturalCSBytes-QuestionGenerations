Alex notices that one of the swimmer's lap counts is consistently increasing. Can Alex predict the performance of this swimmer in the future?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Yes, Alex can predict the swimmer will continue to improve as long as the pattern continues.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"No, Alex cannot predict the swimmer's future performance as it's dependent on the swimmer's health on the day of the swim.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Yes, Alex can predict the swimmer will swim a constant number of laps in every training session.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"No, Alex cannot make any predictions because swimming performance is unpredictable. \",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Data visualizations such as patterns in charts or graphs help to make predictions. So, in this case, if the lap count is consistently increasing over time, it suggests that the swimmer's performance is likely to continue improving in the future.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"import Libraries.Compute.Event\\n\\ninteger lapsSwam\\n\\nclass Swimmer\\n    action swim(integer laps)\\n        lapsSwam = laps\\n        Event:Fire(\\\"Swim\\\")\\n    end\\nend\\n\\nuse Swimmer\\n\\nSwimmer swimmer\\ninteger trainingDay = 1\\n\\nfrom swimmer.Swim repeat time\\n    swimmer:swim(2 * trainingDay)\\n    output \\\"Day \\\", trainingDay, \\\" : Swimmer swam \\\", swimmer.lapsSwam, \\\" laps\\\"\\n    trainingDay = trainingDay + 1\\nend\\n\"\n}"
