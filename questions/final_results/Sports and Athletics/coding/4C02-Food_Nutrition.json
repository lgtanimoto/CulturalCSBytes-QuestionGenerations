The application has a user-interface where Alex can enter the type and quantity of food they eat each day. Behind the scenes, the application has a database that stores the nutritional information of each food item. When Alex enters a food item, the application uses system software to access the hardware, compute the total calories, and return the result to Alex. Which step demonstrates the interaction between the application software and system software?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex entering the type and quantity of food they eat each day.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"The application storing the nutritional information of each food item.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The application using system software to access the hardware and calculate the total calories.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"The application returning the computed calorie result to Alex.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The application software (food intake tracker app) interacts with the system software when it needs to access the hardware (computer's CPU and memory) to perform tasks like fetching data from the database and calculating total calories. The system software manages these hardware resources and allows the app to use them.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action EnterFoodItem(itemName, quantity)\\n    number calories = GetCaloriesFromDatabase(itemName)\\n    totalCalories = totalCalories + (calories * quantity)\\nend\\n\\naction GetCaloriesFromDatabase(itemName)\\n    // Imagine code here to fetch calories from a database using system calls\\n    return fetchedCalories\\nend\"\n}"
