They're creating a program to calculate the number of pollution points in each community based on the amount and types of pollutants. The code snippet from Alex's program simplifies the calculation to focus on the number and type of factories, but it becomes too complex. How can Alex decompose this problem into manageable parts?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex can create a procedure for each pollutant type and then add the points for all pollutants.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex can combine all the calculations into one complex procedure.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex can create a new language for calculating pollution points.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex can perform manual calculations without any procedure.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"By creating a procedure for each pollutant type that calculates the points for that particular pollutant, Alex can make the overall problem much more manageable. They can then add up the total points for all types of pollutants, resulting in a clear and easily understood method for determining the pollution points in a given community.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action Pollution_points(integer factories, integer smoke_quantity)\\n    integer smoke = factories * 3 \\n    integer chemicals = smoke_quantity / 2\\n    integer total_pollution_points = smoke + chemicals \\n    output \\\"Total pollution points: \\\" + total_pollution_points\\nend\"\n}"
