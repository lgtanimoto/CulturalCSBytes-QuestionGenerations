They have found an existing program that identifies low-income neighborhoods, and they want to modify it to locate nearby tech companies willing to donate equipment. Which of the following modifications to the existing code would best help Alex achieve their goal?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Changing the location search query from 'low-income neighborhoods' to 'tech companies'\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Changing the output message from 'Identified low-income neighborhood' to 'Identified potential donor'\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Adding a procedure to verify that the identified neigborhood is indeed a low-income area\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Adding a procedure to count the total number of low-income neighborhoods\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In order to find tech companies that might donate technical equipment, Alex should change the search query of the existing program from 'low-income neighborhoods' to 'tech companies'. This way, the program would search for potential donors instead of low-income areas. Although all the modifications may improve the program, only the first option aligns with Alex's aim of finding tech company donors.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action FindLowIncomeNeighborhoods(text zipcode)\\n    If zipcode is low-income\\n        output \\\"Identified low-income neighborhood\\\"\\n    else\\n        output \\\"This is not a low-income neighborhood\\\"\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
