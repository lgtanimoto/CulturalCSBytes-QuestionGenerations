However, using public networks may also raise security issues about digital privacy. Alex starts to develop a program where students can securely login and log out in public places. In the program given below, what output does Alex's program print on Line 5?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"2\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"3\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"4\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"5\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The integer value for 'numberOfLogins' starts at 0. Alex's program includes a loop where the 'numberOfLogins' increases by 1 for every loop completed. After two loops, the program outputs the value of 'numberOfLogins', which is 2.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"integer numberOfLogins = 0\\nrepeat 2 times\\n    numberOfLogins = numberOfLogins + 1\\nend\\noutput \\\"Number of Logins: \\\" + numberOfLogins\"\n}"
