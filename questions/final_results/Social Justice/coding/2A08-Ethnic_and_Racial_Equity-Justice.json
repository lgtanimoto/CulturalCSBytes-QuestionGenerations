The code takes an article, detects sentences pertaining to ethnic or racial discrimination and counts the number of these sentences. However, Alex is stuck and has two different algorithms to solve the task but is not sure which one to pick. Algorithm A scans every sentence one by one while Algorithm B scans every word looking for key terms related to racial or ethnic discrimination. Which of these algorithms should Alex choose to perform the task more efficiently?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Algorithm A because checking each sentence is faster than checking each word.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Algorithm B because checking each word is faster than checking each sentence.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Both algorithms will provide the same results so it doesn't matter which one Alex chooses.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex should choose the one that is easier for them to implement given their comfort level with the programming language.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Algorithm A scans only the sentences and will be faster due to less number of iterations. While Algorithm B checks every word for key terms even if they don't form a pertinent sentence, hence it will take more time.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"text words[] = splitArticleIntoWords(article)\\ninteger discriminationCount = 0\\nfor each word in words\\n    if isDiscriminationWord(word)\\n        discriminationCount = discriminationCount + 1\\n    end\\nend\\noutput \\\"Number of Discrimination Terms: \\\" + discriminationCount\"\n}"
