They have found two different ways of coding this, methodA() and methodB(). They decide to choose the method which computes more quickly. How could Alex determine which method executes more quickly?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex could use a system timer to measure how long each method takes to execute\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex could use a loop to increment a counter each time a method is called and choose the method with the highest count\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex could run both methods and choose the one that outputs the correct Gini coefficient\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex could ask their friends which one they think will execute faster\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"A system timer would be the best way to accurately measure the execution time of each method. The other options would not provide a reliable measure of how quick each method is, since they rely on manual counting or unsophisticated guesses.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action methodA(items[] item)\\n    integer n = item.length\\n    decimal sum = 0\\n    for integer i = 0 to n\\n        for integer j = 0 to i\\n            sum = sum + absolute(item[i].income - item[j].income)\\n        end\\n    end\\n    decimal gini = sum/(2*n^2*mean(item))\\n    return gini\\nend\"\n}"
