They are asked to analyze data for ten countries and calculate an 'inequality index' based on several factors such as income, education and health. Alex decides to use programming to solve this problem. What change should Alex make to their program so that they can easily store and access the inequality indices of all ten countries?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Create ten different variables, one for each country's inequality index.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Create one variable and update its value each time a new country's inequality index is calculated.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Create a list with ten elements to store the inequality indices of all the countries.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Create a list with one element and update its value each time a new country's inequality index is calculated.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In this scenario, Alex should use a list to store the inequality indices of all countries instead of multiple variables. Lists allow us to store multiple related values together, making it easier to access them later by simply referring to their position in the list.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"list<Number> indices\\nNumber index0, index1, index2, index3, index4, index5, index6, index7, index8, index9\\n// Calculate inequality index for each country and store it in the respective variable\\n// TODO: Store the calculated indices in the indices list instead\"\n}"
