They want to calculate the average housing price in their city and compare it with the median wage. They found a program that gives the median wage, but they need to modify it to also calculate the average house price. Which of the following modifications should Alex make?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Add a loop to add all the prices and divide by the number of houses\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Change the code to output the maximum house price\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Remove the wage calculation part\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Modify the loop to subtract house prices instead of adding them\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"By adding all the prices of the houses and dividing by the total number of houses, we will get the average house price. This adds a new functionality to the program Alex found that fits their needs.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"number totalWage = 0.0\\nnumber wageCount = 0\\nwhile hasNextNumber()\\n    number wage = getNextNumber()\\n    totalWage = totalWage + wage\\n    wageCount = wageCount + 1\\nend\\nnumber medianWage = totalWage / wageCount\\noutput medianWage\"\n}"
