Alex's initial model predicted that location was the most important factor determining housing affordability. However, after collecting data from various resources, they noticed that the affordability is also significantly affected by the size of the house (number of bedrooms) and its amenities. Based on this newly collected data, which action should Alex take to improve their computational model?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex should discard the new data since it contradicts their initial model.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex should refine their model to take into account the size of the house and its amenities while keeping location as a factor.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex should only consider location and ignore other factors while modeling.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex should not change their model since collecting data is part of the process.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"When new data challenges an initial model\u2019s assumptions, it's important to refine the model to accommodate the new findings. Therefore, Alex should revise their model to consider the factors of house size (number of bedrooms), amenities, and location to ensure the model correctly represents the situation.\"\n}"
