The software will allow users to click on a territory and learn more about its history, culture, languages, etc. To construct this software, Alex needs to use several tools and resources. Which of the following represents the most accurate pairing of tools/resources with their corresponding levels of abstraction?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Application Software - Programming languages; System Software - Operating system; Hardware - The database storing the indigenous data\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Application Software - Programming languages; System Software - The database storing the indigenous data; Hardware - Operating system\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Application Software - The database storing the indigenous data; System Software - Operating system; Hardware - Programming languages\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Application Software - The interactive map interface; System Software - Programming languages; Hardware - Operating system\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In this context, the programming languages Alex uses to create the software are part of the application software level. The operating system, which manages the computer's resources and provides a platform for the application software to run on, is part of the system software level. The database storing the indigenous data, as it is a physical medium storing data in a machine-readable format, pertains to the hardware level.\"\n}"
