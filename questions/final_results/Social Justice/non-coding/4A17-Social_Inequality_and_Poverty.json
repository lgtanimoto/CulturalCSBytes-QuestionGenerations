Alex intends to decompose the problem into smaller components to make it manageable. They decide to create different modules for income, education, healthcare, and employment statistics.The module for income will take an array of people's incomes and calculate the income inequality.The education module will take an array of educational attainment data and compute the literacy rate.The healthcare module will analyze an array of people's access to healthcare and compute healthcare accessibility.The employment module will consider employment statistics and calculate unemployment rates.Which of the following statements best helps Alex decompose their problem?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex should write one module that calculates all the statistics at once.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex should write separate modules for each statistic but use the same variables across all modules.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex should write each module in a different programming language to ensure diversity.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex should write separate modules for income, education, healthcare, and employment, and each module should use different variables relevant to its specific purpose.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Decomposing a problem involves breaking it down into smaller, manageable components. Each module that Alex creates should focus on a specific area (income, education, healthcare, or employment) and should use unique variables relevant to its specific purpose.\"\n}"
