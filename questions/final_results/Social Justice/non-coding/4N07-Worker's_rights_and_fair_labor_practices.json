Workers must change their password every two weeks, and every password must contain upper-case letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols. Some of their co-workers have complained about forgetting their passwords often, leading to a loss of productivity. What should Alex suggest as a solution for this problem?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex should tell their co-workers to keep their password simple for easy memorisation, possibly ignoring the password policy.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex should suggest the use of biometric authentication such as fingerprint or facial recognition as a substitute for passwords.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex should suggest that the IT department should keep a record of everyone's passwords so they can help when someone forgets.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex should suggest the implementation of a password management tool that would securely remember the passwords for the users, encouraging complex password use without affecting productivity.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Password managers provide a practical solution for maintaining strong unique passwords for all accounts.
