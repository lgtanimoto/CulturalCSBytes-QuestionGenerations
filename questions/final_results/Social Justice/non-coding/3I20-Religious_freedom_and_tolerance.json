Alex wants to incorporate a bible verse on the app's home screen each day. However, Alex is contemplating including an option for users to customize which verses or other religious texts they want to see on the home screen, or whether they want to see any at all. What is one potential tradeoff that Alex will need to consider when making this decision?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"By not including religious text, the app may be more appealing to a wider range of people, but Alex's personal values may not be as prominently expressed.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Including customization options for religious texts will show respect for religious diversity, but it will take more time and effort to develop such a feature.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"By including religious text, the application may end up being used primarily by religious organizations which may limit the potential user demographic.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Providing an option for users to customize religious text or verse will require storing personal information, which may raise privacy concerns.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"While accommodating more people's beliefs may widen the appeal of the application, adding more customization options will require more development time. Making the app more appealing to a wider audience may also increase potential revenue from the app.\"\n}"
