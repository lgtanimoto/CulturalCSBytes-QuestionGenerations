They have to send their artwork file which is of 50 MB size to their artwork partner, Charlie, over the internet as an email attachment. But due to the limitation of their email service, files more than 25 MB can't be sent in one go. How can Alex make sure Charlie gets the whole file without any issue?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex should compress the file to reduce its size.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex should break down the file into smaller packets of allowable size and send them iteratively.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex should print the artwork and mail it instead.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex should abandon the project as it can't be sent over email.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In computer science, large files are often broken down into smaller packets, much like in the art principle of composition where bigger concepts are composed of smaller elements. These packets can be sent separately over networks and the internet and are then reassembled at the receiving end back into the original file.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"integer fileSize = 50\\ninteger maxAllowedSize = 25\\ninteger numberOfPackets = fileSize / maxAllowedSize\\nif fileSize modulo maxAllowedSize > 0\\n    numberOfPackets = numberOfPackets + 1\\nend\\noutput \\\"File will be broken into \\\" + numberOfPackets + \\\" packets.\\\"\"\n}"
