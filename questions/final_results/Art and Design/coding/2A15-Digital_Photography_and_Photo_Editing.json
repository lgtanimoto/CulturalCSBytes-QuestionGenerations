They created a procedure that calculates the average brightness of a picture and adjusts it in relation to the desired brightness. However, when testing the program with one of their photos, it didn't change the brightness as expected. What debug step should Alex use first?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex should check if the procedure that adjusts the brightness is being called correctly.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex should delete and re-write their whole program.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex should ignore the problem and hope it works with other photos.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex should use a brighter picture to test the program.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The first step in debugging is to identify where the problem might be. Given that the photo's brightness didn't change as expected, it's probable that the procedure calling the brightness adjustor isn't working correctly. Therefore, Alex should first check if this is the case before doing anything else.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action adjustBrightness(Picture photo, number desiredBrightness) returns Picture\\n    number avgBrightness = computeAverageBrightness(photo)\\n    if avgBrightness < desiredBrightness\\n        increaseBrightness(photo, desiredBrightness - avgBrightness)\\n    elseif avgBrightness > desiredBrightness\\n        decreaseBrightness(photo, avgBrightness - desiredBrightness)\\n    end\\n    return photo\\nend\"\n}"
