Now, Alex wants to create a program to organize their artwork based on colors used. For that, they will create a pie chart. In the below code snippet Alex initally counts the colors used in different artworks and stores the count in a dictionary. Considering this, what could be the next step Alex should take to create the pie chart?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Initiate a loop via each key in the dictionary.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Create a new dictionary to store the percentages of colors used.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Calculate the percentage of each color used and create an array to store these percentages.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Print out the color dictionary.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"After counting the colors, the next step for Alex would be to calculate the percentages of each color used across all the artworks. This can be done by dividing individual color count by the total color count. These percentages can be stored in an array that will then be used to create pie chart slices.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"use Libraries.Containers.Dictionary\\nDictionary colorCounts\\n// Counting the colors\\ncolorCounts:Add(\\\"Blue\\\", 36)\\ncolorCounts:Add(\\\"Green\\\", 42)\\ncolorCounts:Add(\\\"Red\\\", 55)\\ncolorCounts:Add(\\\"Yellow\\\", 63)\\ncolorCounts:Add(\\\"Pink\\\", 80)\\ncolorCounts:Add(\\\"Purple\\\", 23)\\ncolorCounts:Add(\\\"Black\\\", 66)\\ncolorCounts:Add(\\\"White\\\", 120)\"\n}"
