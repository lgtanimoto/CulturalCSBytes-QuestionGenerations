They have written a function to adjust the brightness of an image. The function takes an image object and an integer as inputs and modifies the image object by increasing the brightness index of each pixel by the given integer. What would be an accurate comment to add at the beginning of the function to explain its functionality?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"// This function takes in an image and a number and increases the brightness of the image by decreasing the pixel value by the given number\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"// This function takes in an image and a number and decreases the brightness of the image by increasing the pixel value by the given number\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"// This function takes in an image and a number and makes images beautiful\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"// This function takes in an image and a number and increases the brightness of the image by increasing the pixel value by the given number\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In digital images, brightness is manipulated by adjusting pixel values. Increments in pixel values lead to brighter images hence the described function increases brightness by increasing pixel values by a passed value.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action IncreaseBrightness(Image img, integer value)\\n    number pixels = img.GetPixels()\\n    for each pixel in pixels\\n        pixel = pixel + value\\n    end\\n    img.SetPixels(pixels)\\nend\"\n}"
