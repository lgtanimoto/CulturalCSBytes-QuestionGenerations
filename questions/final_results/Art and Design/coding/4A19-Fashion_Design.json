They have just finished a beta version of the program and decide to run some tests. After several friends use the program, they give Alex some feedback: the outfits are too random, and often the color combinations are not good. Which of the following updates to Alex\u2019s program to address this feedback is the most systematic approach?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Randomly generate each piece of clothing, but make sure that each piece is a different color.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Allow the user to choose the colors for their outfit, but randomly generate the style of each piece.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Create pre-made outfits and have the program randomly choose one of these outfits.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Create a list of colors that go well together, and randomly generate outfits using only these colors.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"This option maintains the random nature of the outfit generation while improving the color combinations. It directly addresses the feedback by ensuring the color combinations are always good. It also helps in developing programs for broad audiences as it incorporates user feedback.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"integer brim = 0\\ninteger jacket = 0\\ninteger pants = 0\\ninteger shoes = 0\\nbrim = Random(1, 3)\\njacket = Random(1, 3)\\npants = Random(1, 3)\\nshoes = Random(1, 3)\\noutput \\\"Your outfit combination: \\\" + brim + \\\" \\\" + jacket + \\\" \\\" + pants + \\\" \\\" + shoes\"\n}"
