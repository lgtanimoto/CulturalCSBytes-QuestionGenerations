Comment out lines or add print statements to understand the flow of execution.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Keep trying different solutions until the program works. That is the best way to debug.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Debugging means solving problems in the code. The best way to go about this is to think logically and track down the origins of the problem. This often means following the error messages to the line where the error occurs, and tracking the behavior of the variables and functions involved.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"integer posterWidth = 36\\ninteger posterHeight = 48\\ninteger imageStartX = posterWidth/4\\ninteger imageStartY = posterHeight/4\\nstring title = \\\"Annual Fun Fest\\\"\\nstring date = \\\"20th June\\\"\\nstring venue = \\\"City Park\\\"\\n//TODO: Code to transfer these variables into a poster design\"\n}"
