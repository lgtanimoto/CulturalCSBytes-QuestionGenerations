They are trying to make a 3D model of a cube in a digital design program using a code snippet in Quorum programming language, but they are struggling. Which of the following Quorum procedures likely creates a cube in this digital design program?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"CreateCube(number sides, number dimension)\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"CreateSquare(number dimension)\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Cube(number edge)\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"ModelCube(number edge)\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Like a cube, a sculpture is an artifact created using procedures within a program. The CreateCube procedure with sides and dimensions as arguments would likely create a cube in this digital design program.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"CreateCube(6, 2)\"\n}"
