They wrote this initial code:After receiving user feedback that they often need to use the same color multiple times throughout their projects, Alex wants to add a feature to remember the last-used color. Which of these changes will most effectively meet the users' needs, without changing the current functionality?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Add a new variable called colorSelection to keep track of the current color, and update this value whenever the user changes the color.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Change the name of the getRGB() function to getColor() to make it clearer.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Add instructions at the top of the code explaining how to use the color selection feature.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Change the setColor() function to take three parameters instead of an RGB value.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Adding a variable to keep track of the current color selection will allow Alex to remember the last color used, which meets the user's needs without changing the current functionality of getting RGB values or setting color. The other options don't help to keep track of the last used color.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"class ColorPicker\\n    action setColor(number value)\\n        // code to set color\\n    end\\n\\n    action getRGB(number red, number green, number blue) returns number\\n        // code to return RGB value\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
