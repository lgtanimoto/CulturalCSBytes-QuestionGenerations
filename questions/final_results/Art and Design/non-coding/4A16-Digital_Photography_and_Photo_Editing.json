They decide to use their coding skills to design a program that adjusts the brightness and contrast of their photos based on the input provided by the user. Which of the following procedures best represents the 'brightness' adjustment feature of Alex's program?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"action Brightness(Image myImage, integer level)each pixel in myImageadd level to pixel's redadd level to pixel's greenadd level to pixel's blueend\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"action Brightness(Image myImage, integer level)each pixel in myImagesubtract level from pixel's redsubtract level from pixel's greensubtract level from pixel's blueend\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"action Brightness(Image myImage, integer level)multiply each pixel's red, green, and blue values by level\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"action Brightness(Image myImage, integer level)if level > 0multiply each pixel's red, green, and blue values by levelelseadd level to each pixel's red, green, and blue valuesend\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"A simple model for brightness adjustment in photos involves adding a constant value to the red, green, and blue color components of each pixel in the image. A positive value increases lightness and a negative value reduces lightness.\"\n}"
