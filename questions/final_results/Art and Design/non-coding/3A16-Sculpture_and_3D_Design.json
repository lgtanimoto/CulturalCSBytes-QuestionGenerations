    "question_str": "{\n    \"Question\": \"Sasha is in a 3D Design class and has been asked to create a virtual model of their sculpture before creating it in real life. They have already created digital models of different parts of the sculpture using a 3D design software. Now they need to combine all these parts in a specific sequence to create the entire sculpture. Sasha remembers a piece of code they used in their computer science class that arranged different elements in a specific order. How should they incorporate the code into their design process?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Sasha should start from scratch, ignoring the code since it was written for a different problem\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Sasha should copy and paste the code into the 3D design software without any modifications or annotations\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Sasha should analyze the code, possibly modifying and incorporating it into their 3D model, giving attribution in the software/comments where the old code was included and modified\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Sasha doesn't need to credit the source of the code because they wrote it for a different class\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Incorporating existing code into new projects is a common practice in computer science. It is recommended to credit the source of the code, and in many cases, required. Moreover, properly annotating where and how the code was integrated can help others understand the logic behind the model. Furthermore, reusing and modifying code can save time and resources.\"\n}"
