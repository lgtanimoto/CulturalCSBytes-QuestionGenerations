Recently, Alex has been experimenting with 3D printing to create intricate components of their sculptures. They realize that while traditional methods themselves are satisfying for their craftsmanship, 3D printing has dramatically changed the world of sculpture by allowing for precise, repeatable, and complex structures that would be impossible or very time-consuming to craft by hand. However, Alex understands that this technology has limitations too. Which of the following is a correct statement?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"3D printing always produces cheaper and quicker results than traditional sculpture methods.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"3D printing can be used to print sculptures out of any material, including all metals and ceramics.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"3D printing, while revolutionary, is not capable of capturing the fine details and unique characteristics that can be achieved with traditional methods.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"The use of 3D printing in sculpting does not have any influence on cultural practices connected to sculpture.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"While 3D printing technology has greatly expanded the possibilities of design and manufacturing, it does not replace traditional methods in terms of specific details and unique craftsmanship. Each has its own strengths and creates different cultural impacts.\"\n}"
