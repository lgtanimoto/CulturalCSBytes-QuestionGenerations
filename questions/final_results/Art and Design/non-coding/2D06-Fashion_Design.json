To decide on their color palette, Alex decided to conduct a survey among school students asking about their favorite colors. Alex collected the survey results and wants to present the information visually to make the color selection process easier. Using Python's libraries such as Matplotlib, how should Alex proceed to create a pie chart representing the color preferences among the surveyed students?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Using a dictionary where the keys are the different colors and the values are the number of students who preferred that color. Then use the 'plot.pie()' function on this dictionary with the right parameters.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Creating a bar chart would be more suitable in this scenario.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex should create a scatter plot where the x-axis is the different colors and the y-axis is the number of students who preferred each color.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"They can simply list down all the colors and the corresponding responses in a table in a Jupyter notebook.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Creating a pie chart is a good way to represent the favorite colors of the students who took the survey. This can be easily done using Matplotlib's 'plot.pie()' function. Bar chart and scatter plot could also be used, but they won't be as effective in showing the dominant colors as a pie chart would. Listing the colors and the responses won't visualize the data.\"\n}"
