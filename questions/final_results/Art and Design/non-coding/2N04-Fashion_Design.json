To ensure that people visiting their portfolio site can view the images efficiently, how does the platform make this possible?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"The platform creates a direct virtual tunnel between Alex's computer and the viewer's device, transmitting the entire image file at once.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"The platform provides the viewer with Alex's IP address, allowing the viewer to access the image files directly from Alex's computer.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The platform divides the image files into smaller packets, sends them over the internet, and upon reaching the viewer's device, these packets are reassembled into the original complete image.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"The platform compresses the image file to its smallest size and sends it in one batch to the viewer's device.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In the digital world, particularly on the internet, large files such as high-resolution images are broken down into smaller data packets. These packets are then individually transmitted over the network to the destination device where they are reassembled to form the original file. This way, even if some packets face delays or are lost, the transmission continues smoothly, and the file can be viewed as soon as enough packets have been received and reassembled.\"\n}"
