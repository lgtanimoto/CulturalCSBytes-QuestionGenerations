They then start a loop for each design, where they subtract the costs (production fees, artist fees, and taxes) from the selling price \u2013 a form of event manipulation. After the loop ends (after calculating the profit for all designs), they print the total profit \u2013 a final action triggering the sequence end.\"\n}"
