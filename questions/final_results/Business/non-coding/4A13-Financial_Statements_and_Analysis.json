Alex plans to leverage their programming knowledge to create a program that will automate the calculation of some of these KPIs using the company\u2019s Financial Statements. Alex\u2019s classmates are having a hard time understanding the programming aspect of Alex's finance project. How can Alex decompose or break down their program into steps or modules that are understandable even to non-programmers?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex should write the entire program in one go and then try to explain it to their classmates.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex should create a step-by-step flow diagram of the program logic using financial terms instead of the technical terms.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex should write the program without explaining the process, as it might confuse non-technical people.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex should create a glossary of the technical terms used in the program to explain it to the classmates.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Decomposition is all about breaking down the problem into manageable pieces. Since the classmates are having a hard time understanding the programming part, instead of using programming language terms Alex can use finance terms and explain the logic flow using a diagram. This way the classmates will understand the process using the context of their own knowledge and subject expertise.\"\n}"
