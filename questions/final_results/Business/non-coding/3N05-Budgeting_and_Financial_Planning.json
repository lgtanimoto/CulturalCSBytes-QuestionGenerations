Alex scans all receipts and saves them on their phone. To protect these important financial documents, what steps should Alex take to secure their electronic information?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex should store all scanned receipts on a thumb drive and hide it.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex should set a passcode on their phone to restrict unauthorized access. They should also use a secure app to store the scanned images and frequently backup the data to a trusted virtual cloud storage.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex does not need to do anything since scanned documents can\u2019t be stolen or lost.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex should share the scanned images with a trusted friend for safekeeping.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Setting up a passcode, use of secure app and consistent back-up are beneficial security measures that Alex should perform to protect their electronic information. Sharing private information even with trusted ones can potentially risk its security. Copying data only to a thumb drive doesn't secure it against data loss and storing data on phone without security also risk theft or unauthorized access.\"\n}"
