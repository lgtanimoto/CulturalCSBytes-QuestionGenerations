They quickly notice that the process of assessing the potential of a business idea is repetitive and could be automated. Alex thinks of a procedure in which an idea is input and the output indicates whether it is a good idea or not based on previous data. Which of the following code best represents this procedure?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"procedure evaluateBusinessIdea(number averageProfit, number startupCosts)if averageProfit > startupCostsreturn 'Good Idea'elsereturn 'Bad Idea'endend\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"procedure evaluateBusinessIdea(data BusinessIdea)if BusinessIdea.averageProfit > BusinessIdea.startupCostsreturn 'Good Idea'elsereturn 'Bad Idea'endend\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"procedure evaluateBusinessIdea(data BusinessIdea)boolean ideaValuationif BusinessIdea.averageProfit > BusinessIdea.startupCostsideaValuation = trueelsereturn ideaValuation = falseendreturn ideaValuationend\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"procedure evaluateBusinessIdea()number averageProfit = getInput('Enter average profit: ')number startupCosts = getInput('Enter startup costs: ')if averageProfit > startupCostsreturn 'Good Idea'elsereturn 'Bad Idea'endend\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The most efficient procedure to evaluate a business idea would use a Business Idea object as a parameter. This object could include all the necessary data fields like averageProfit, startupCosts, marketSize, etc., allowing the procedure to be easily reused for other ideas.\"\n}"
