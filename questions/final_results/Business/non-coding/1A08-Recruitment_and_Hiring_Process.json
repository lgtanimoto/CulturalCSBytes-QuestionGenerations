They need to create a program algorithm to perform the process of 'Reviewing Applicants' as described by the company: First, an application is received. Next, if the application is complete, it's assigned to a hiring manager. If the application is incomplete, it's set aside. If the hiring manager rates the application positively, schedule an interview. If it's rated negatively, inform the applicant that they won't be moving forward. Which of the following pseudocodes best represents this process?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"procedure ReviewingApplicants\\n    while applications remain       \\n    if application is complete then \\n        assign to hiring manager  \\n        if rated positively\\n            schedule interview\\n        else\\n            reject applicant\\n        end if\\n    else \\n        set aside\\n    end if\\n    end while\\nend procedure\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"procedure ReviewingApplicants\\n    while applications remain\\n    if application is incomplete\\n        set aside\\n    else \\n        assign to hiring manager\\n        if application is incompelete \\n            set aside\\n        else \\n            reject or interview applicant\\n        end if\\n    end if\\n    end while\\nend procedure\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"procedure ReviewingApplicants\\n    while applications remain\\n        assign to hiring manager\\n        if rated negatively\\n            reject applicant\\n        else\\n            schedule interview\\n        end if\\n    end while\\nend procedure\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"procedure ReviewingApplicants\\n    while applications remain\\n        if application is complete\\n            assign to hiring manager\\n            if rated negatively\\n                reject applicant\\n            else\\n                schedule interview\\n            end if\\n        end if\\n    end while\\nend procedure\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The proper pseudocode would include all steps from receiving the application, checking if it's complete or not, assigning it to a hiring manager, up to making a decision based on the manager's rating and either scheduling an interview or rejecting the candidate.\"\n}"
