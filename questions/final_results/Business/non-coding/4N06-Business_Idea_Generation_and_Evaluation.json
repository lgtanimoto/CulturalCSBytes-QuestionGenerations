The app requires babysitters to provide extensive personal information and checks this against various public and private databases to ensure babysitters' authenticity. In order to protect the babysitters' personal information, Alex needs to implement security measures. Which of the following security measures should Alex potentially employ?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex should store all personal information in plain text and provide open access to all developers to speed up development time.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex should implement strong password protections, enable multi-factor authentication, encrypt all personal information and rigorously control developer access.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex should forgo the background checking aspect of the app to avoid storing potentially sensitive information.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex should sell the personal information to offset the costs of background checks and database authentication.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Protecting personal data is extremely important both ethically and legally, and it should be a priority in any system that handles such data. Using strong password protections, enabling multi-factor authentication (2FA), and encrypting the data provides a layered security approach. Additionally, limiting developer access to production data can help prevent data leaks and breaches.\"\n}"
