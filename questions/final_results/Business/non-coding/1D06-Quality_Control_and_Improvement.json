Here are their results: Week 1 = 30, Week 2 = 25, Week 3 = 15, and Week 4 = 10. Which of the following are appropriate ways for Alex to present this data visually?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Pie chart only\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Line chart only\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Bar chart only\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Both the line chart and the bar chart\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Both a bar chart and a line chart can be used to properly visualize the week-by-week changes in defective parts counted. A pie chart wouldn't be helpful in this scenario because it is better suited to compare parts of a whole, while in this situation, it is important to show the change of numbers over time.\"\n}"
