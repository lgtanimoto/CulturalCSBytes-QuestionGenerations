To help their classmates understand, Alex likens the process to a pizza delivery system, where a pizza (the data) is divided into slices (packets) and each slice is transported separately before being assembled again at the destination (the end device). Is this analogy accurate, and why?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Yes, because each slice is the same size and contains the same ingredients, just like each data packet is the same size and contains the same information.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"No, because a pizza can only be baked all at once, whereas data packets can be transmitted simultaneously over different routes.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Yes, because both systems ensure that every slice arrives at its destination, even if it takes a different route than the others.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"No, because pizza slices can get lost or damaged during delivery, whereas data packets are always transmitted perfectly without any loss or damage.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Just like a pizza is split into slices, information is broken into smaller packets for transmission. And just as each pizza slice might take a different route but still arrives at its final destination, each data packet might take a different route through the network but is reassembled at the receiving device to form the complete message.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"class Packet\\n    string data\\n    integer destination\\n    integer origin\\n    boolean delivered = false\\n\\n    action Deliver()\\n        // Code to send packet to destination...\\n        delivered = true\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
