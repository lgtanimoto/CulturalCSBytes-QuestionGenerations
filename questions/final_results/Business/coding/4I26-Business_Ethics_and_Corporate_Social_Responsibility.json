They've created an algorithm to calculate a sustainability score, which helps businesses monitor their impact in terms of environmental, economic, and social factors. However, they're not sure if their algorithm will apply to all companies across different sectors. What should Alex do to ensure the applicability of their algorithm to different sectors?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"They should design their algorithm so it exclusively favors businesses in the energy sector, since they impact the environment the most.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"They should design their algorithm so it accounts for the specific attributes of each company under consideration, including the sector in which it operates.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"They should design their algorithm to only consider environmental factors as they are universally applicable to all sectors.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"They should avoid considering economic factors in their algorithm as they vary greatly between sectors.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"An algorithm can be adapted to solve problems across different disciplines if it is designed to account for the particular attributes of each situation. In this case, each sector might have different impacts and responsibilities in the areas of environment, economy, and society, and the algorithm should take these into consideration for a fair and accurate sustainability score.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"number environmental_impact = getEnvironmentalImpact(company)\\nnumber economic_impact = getEconomicImpact(company)\\nnumber social_impact = getSocialImpact(company)\\nnumber total_impact = environmental_impact + economic_impact + social_impact\\nnumber sustainability_score = total_impact / getCompanySize(company)\\noutput sustainability_score\"\n}"
