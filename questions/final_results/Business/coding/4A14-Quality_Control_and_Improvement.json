Their task is to inspect the finished garments and mark them as 'Passed' if they meet the required quality standards and 'Failed' if they do not. They are equipped with a computer program that helps them mark the inspection results. Here is the list of the last 20 garments Alex inspected: ['Passed', 'Passed', 'Failed', 'Passed', 'Passed', 'Failed', 'Passed', 'Passed', 'Passed', 'Passed', 'Failed', 'Failed', 'Passed', 'Passed', 'Passed', 'Failed', 'Passed', 'Passed', 'Failed', 'Passed']. Alex wants to quickly find out how many garments failed the quality inspection. How can they modify the program to compute this?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Add a separate variable for each garment to keep track of its status.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Use a loop to iterate over the list and increment a count each time the garment status is 'Failed'.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Sort the list in alphabetical order so that all the 'Failed' garments are grouped together.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Delete all the 'Passed' garments from the list, then count the remaining 'Failed' garments.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Using a loop to iterate over the list and increment a count each time the garment status is 'Failed' is the most efficient way to solve this problem.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"list<text> inspectionStatus = ['Passed', 'Passed', 'Failed', 'Passed', 'Passed', 'Failed', 'Passed', 'Passed', 'Passed', 'Passed', 'Failed', 'Failed', 'Passed', 'Passed', 'Passed', 'Failed', 'Passed', 'Passed', 'Failed', 'Passed']\\ninteger failedCount = 0\\nfor every item i in inspectionStatus\\n   if i == \\\"Failed\\\"\\n      failedCount = failedCount + 1\\n   end\\nend\\noutput failedCount\"\n}"
