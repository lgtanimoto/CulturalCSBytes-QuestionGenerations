They use loops and conditional statements to manage their budget and check if they have overspent. Given the following code snippet, what will be the output when Alex's income is $5000, and their expenses are as follows: rent -$2000, food -$1500, entertainment -$500?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Budget status: Good job! You have saved $1000 this month.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Budget status: Warning! You have overspent by $1000 this month.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Budget status: Good job! You have saved $2000 this month.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Budget status: Warning! You have overspent by $500 this month.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The program calculates Alex's remaining budget by subtracting their total expenses from their income. In this case, $5000 - ($2000 + $1500 + $500) equals $1000. As this remaining amount is not less than 0, the message 'Good job! You have saved $1000 this month.' gets output.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"integer income = 5000\\ninteger rent = 2000\\ninteger food = 1500\\ninteger entertainment = 500\\ninteger remaining = income - (rent + food + entertainment)\\nif remaining < 0\\n    output \\\"Budget status: Warning! You have overspent by \\\" + (-remaining) + \\\" this month.\\\"\\nelse\\n    output \\\"Budget status: Good job! You have saved \\\" + remaining + \\\" this month.\\\"\\nend\"\n}"
