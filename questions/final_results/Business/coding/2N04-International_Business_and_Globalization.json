    "question_str": "{\n    \"Question\": \"Alex is attempting to understand how international business and globalization works. They start studying network packets and transmission over the Internet. Say they model a business deal between two companies in different countries as an internet transmission. In this model, could Alex consider separate business tasks in the deal as packets? How could they create a program to simulate this?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Yes, packets could be seen as separate business tasks. They could create a program that has a function for each separate business task involved in the international deal, and call them in sequence.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"No, packets shouldn't be seen as separate business tasks because business tasks are too complex. They cannot be modeled in a computer simulation.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Yes, packets could be seen as separate business tasks. They could create an array in which each element represents a separate business task and execute them in order.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Yes, packets could be seen as separate business tasks. However, programming cannot replicate real life scenarios in terms of complexity and human behavior.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"While the complexities of a business deal certainly go beyond a basic program's capabilities, on a basic level, Alex could model it as a series of tasks, or 'packets', that need to be executed. Analogous to a data transmission, various tasks (like negotiations, signings, due diligence, etc.) would need to be executed sequentially for the business deal to be successful.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action Negotiation() \\n    // Code for negotiation goes here \\nend \\n\\naction ContractSigning() \\n    // Code for contract signing goes here \\nend \\n\\naction DueDiligence() \\n    // Code for due diligence goes here \\nend \\n\\n// Simulate business deal \\nNegotiation() \\nContractSigning() \\nDueDiligence() \\n//Deal is complete\"\n}"
