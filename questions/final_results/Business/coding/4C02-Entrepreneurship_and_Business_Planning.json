If Alex is operating their application on a smartphone, which of the following best describes a direct interaction between the application software and a hardware component?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Alex's app sending a notification which lights up the screen of the smarthphone.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Alex's app getting an OS update.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Alex's app being downloaded from an app store.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Alex's app changing the brightness of the screen when the phone is unlocked.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The Screen of a smartphone is a hardware component. When Alex's app sends a notification, the application software directly interacts with the hardware by making it light up. Alex's app changing the brightness of the screen is also a direct interaction but only happens if the phone is unlocked which is a condition dependent on the System Software (OS). Hence, Answer 1 is a more direct interaction.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action SendNotification() \\n    if appIsActive = false \\n        DisplayNotification(\\\"New update!\\\") \\n    end \\nend\"\n}"
