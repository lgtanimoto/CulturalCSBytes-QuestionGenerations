They want to add a feature to their program that was inspired by an open-source project they saw online.

Alex should include clear citations in the documentation, comments, or program metadata, and should adhere to any licensing requirements of the open-source project.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action calculateRestock(integer currentInventory, integer desiredInventory)\\n    if currentInventory < desiredInventory\\n        integer restock = desiredInventory - currentInventory\\n        output \\\"Restock quantity for the item is: \\\" + restock \\n    else\\n        output \\\"No restock needed.\\\"\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
