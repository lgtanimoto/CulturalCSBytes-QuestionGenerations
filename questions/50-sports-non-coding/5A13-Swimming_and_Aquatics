The subsequent days she swims 10 meters farther than what she swam the previous day. Here is the code snippet for the calculation:If Penny continues her routine for another week, what will be her total distance swam over the next week starting from day 8?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"560 meters\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"350 meters\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"330 meters\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"490 meters\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The given code represents a recursive algorithm that adds 10 to the swim distance of the previous day. The swim distance of day 8 is day7+10=70 meters, day 9 is day8+10=80, and so on. Thus, the total distance for the next week is 70+80+90+100+110+120+130 = 700 meters.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"function swim(distance, day)\\n  if day == 1\\n    return distance\\n  else \\n    return distance + swim(distance + 10, day -1)\\n  end\\n\"\n}"
