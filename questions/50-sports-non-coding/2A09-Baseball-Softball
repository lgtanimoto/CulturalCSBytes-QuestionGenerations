She needs two variables, one to keep the running total of her home runs, and another to store the number of new home runs during a game. If Amelia starts this season with zero home runs, and hits 3 home runs in her first game and 5 home runs in her second game, what is the value of her 'totalHomeruns' variable after the second game is over?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"2\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"3\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"5\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"8\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Amelia's 'totalHomeruns' variable would start at 0. After her first game, it would increase to 3 (0 + 3 home runs). After her second game, it would increase to 8 (3 + 5 home runs). Therefore, the correct answer is 8.\"\n}"
