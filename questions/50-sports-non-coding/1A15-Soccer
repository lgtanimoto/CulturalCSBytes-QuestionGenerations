Describe the choices and steps she took during the iterative development process while creating this program.\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"I wrote all the code in one go, then I ran it to see if it worked.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"I used my gut feeling to decide that we were ready to launch the program.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"I started by writing a small part of the code to calculate player stats, then tested it to make sure it worked as expected. Then I added the next part of the code to calculate team winning probabilities, testing at each stage to ensure no errors occurred. I made revisions where necessary in response to test feedback. Finally, once all components were working as expected, I integrated them into one complete program.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"I dreamt about the solution and then coded it when I woke up.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Jillian made the choice to build her program in pieces, testing each part individually before combining them. This is a typical process in iterative development, which involves repeated cycles of designing, testing, and refining a program.\"\n}"
