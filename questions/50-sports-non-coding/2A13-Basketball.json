As part of their iterative development process, they interviewed users (basketball players and coaches) to incorporate their perspectives into the design. How might the students modify their program based on each of the following user feedback?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"\\\"I need a way to fix errors when I accidentally input the wrong score type.\\\"\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"\\\"I want to know how many points each player scores.\\\"\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"\\\"I need to track both game and season-long scoring statistics.\\\"\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"\\\"I would like an easy and fast way to enter scores.\\\"\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In this case, the user feedback indicates the need for a function in the program to correct or modify previously input data. This suggests that the students might need to include an option to edit or remove specific scoring attributions once they have been entered. The other answers are valid modifications according to user feedback, but they are beyond the scope of this iteration.\",\n    \"Feedback1\": \"This feedback suggests that the students might need to include an option to edit or remove specific scoring attributions once they have been entered.\",\n    \"Feedback2\": \"This feedback suggests that the students might have to add a feature to track individual player scores.\",\n    \"Feedback3\": \"This feedback implies that the students might need to build a feature that can calculate and store both individual game data and cumulative data for the season.\",\n    \"Feedback4\": \"This feedback indicates a need for a user-friendly and efficient system for entering scores, perhaps using buttons or hotkeys.\"\n}"
