His program takes an array of objects representing different plays, in which each object contains properties 'yards', 'playType' ('pass', 'run', or 'penalty') and 'quarter'. Trevor has noticed his calculations are incorrect and suspects the 'penalties' are not being recording correctly. Which test cases could Trevor use to refine his program?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Test with an empty array of plays; Test with an array of plays containing only runs; Test with an array of plays containing only passes.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Test with an array of plays containing only penalties; Test with an array of plays where all plays are from the same quarter; Test with an array of plays where all plays are from different quarters.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Test with an array of plays containing only penalties; Test with an array of plays containing penalties interspersed with runs and passes; Check if penalties are subtracted from the total yardage.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Test with an array of plays where each play gains exactly one yard; Test with an array of plays where each play gains a random amount of yards.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Since Trevor suspects the problem is with how penalties are being recorded, it would be best to create tests that check how the program handles penalties alone, and how it handles penalties mixed with other play types. He should also check if penalties subtract from the total yardage as they should in football.\"\n}"
