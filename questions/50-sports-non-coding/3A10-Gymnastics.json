The program needs to collect scores from 5 judges for each participant, then drop the lowest and highest scores and calculate the average of the remaining scores. Write a pseudocode or draw a flowchart that outlines the steps and decisions needed for this process.\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Pseudocode:\\nInitialize scores array\\nFOR each judge\\n      Input score\\n      Add score to scores array\\nENDFOR\\nSort scores array\\nRemove first element from scores array\\nRemove last element from scores array\\nCompute average of scores array\\nOutput average\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Flowchart:\\nStart -> Input Scores -> Sort Scores -> Remove First Element -> Remove Last Element -> Calculate Average -> End\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"None of the above.
