The app will monitor each athlete's GPS, evaluating their progress and helping to prevent them from getting lost during cross country races. While the team is excited about the benefits of the app, some athletes express concerns about their privacy. Which of the following is a valid concern they might raise?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Veering slightly off the designated path during a race might lead to disqualification.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"The GPS in their phones might not be accurate, leading to incorrect assessments of their performance.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The app might continue to track their location outside of practices and meets, potentially infringing on their personal privacy rights.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"The app might not be compatible with all models of smartphones, leaving some athletes at a disadvantage.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The athletes' concerns about the app possibly tracking their location outside of practices and meets is valid. While the benefits of the app in terms of safety and monitoring progress are clear, it also raises questions about privacy and whether or not it's ethical to possibly infringe upon the athletes' personal privacy rights. This is a good example of evaluating the social and economic implications of privacy in the context of safety, law, or ethics.\"\n}"
