    "question_str": "{\n    \"Question\": \"Imagine you are consulting for a start-up company which aims to revolutionize the sport of volleyball through technology. They've developed an AI-based system that offers real-time coaching input to players and teams based on their movements and the dynamics of the game. What are some potential beneficial and harmful effects that this computational artifact could have on the sport of volleyball?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"The system could help players and teams improve quickly, leading to more competitive and interesting games. Yet, it may contribute to widening the gap between teams that can afford such technology and those who can't.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"The system could cause players to rely too much on technology for game strategy, reducing the human element of the game. However, it could also help injured players to compensate for physical limitations by improving their game intelligence.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The system could provoke privacy issues as it needs to collect extensive data on the movements of players. Yet, it could bring a higher level of excitement and engagement among fans as they could access in-depth analyses of games.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"The system could be seen as a threat to coaches and their roles in teams, potentially leading to less job opportunities. Nevertheless, it could help them to understand their players and the game on a much deeper level, thereby enhancing their coaching ability.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"There is no correct answer as students are expected to discuss and evaluate various beneficial and harmful effects this technology might have on society.\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The impacts of technological advancements are manifold and oftentimes ambiguous, especially when it comes to sports which have traditionally remained unmoved by technology. The students are encouraged to think critically and holistically, keeping different stakeholders in mind.\"\n}"
