Some of Ember's teammates are worried about the tool constantly recording videos of them during practice, potentially violating their privacy. Which of the following actions should the coach consider to maximize the tool's benefits while minimizing potential harm?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Ignore the concerns of the team and continue using the tool as planned. The benefits of detailed performance analysis outweigh any privacy concerns.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Develop a new machine learning tool from scratch that respects user privacy.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Opt out of using any technology in coaching and return to traditional coaching methods.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Discuss with the team and decide collectively on rules for using the tool, such as only recording videos with each gymnast's consent and ensuring the videos are securely stored and used only for coaching purposes.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"It's important to consider both positive and negative societal effects when using computational artifacts. Engaging in dialogue with the people who are affected by the technology and creating rules that respect privacy and consent is a good way to reap the benefits while minimizing harm.\",\n    \"video_clip\": \"A video shows a gymnast practicing on the beam. A box is drawn around the gymnast, marking them as the object of interest by the video analysis tool.\"\n}"
