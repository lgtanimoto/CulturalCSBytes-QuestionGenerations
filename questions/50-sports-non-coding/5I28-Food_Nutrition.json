During app development, he learns that the country where most of his users live has strict laws about displaying nutritional information, including a requirement that all nutritional information displayed must be verified by a registered dietitian. Which of the following is Zephyr most likely to debate?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Whether the requirement for a registered dietitian to verify all information might limit the range of foods his app can provide information on, due to cost and accessibility issues.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Whether he should include fun factors in his app like games and reward systems to encourage users to use the app more often.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Whether his users will appreciate the accurate and verified information and give his app a higher rating.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Whether his app should focus more on tracking daily nutrition intake instead of meal suggestions.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Since laws have been affecting the development of Zephyr's app, he is likely to question the fairness and implementation of such laws, like whether a registered dietitian is necessary to verify each piece of data or if this might create unnecessary constraints on his app's development.\"\n}"
