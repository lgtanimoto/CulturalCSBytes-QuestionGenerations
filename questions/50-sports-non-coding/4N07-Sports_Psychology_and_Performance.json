He wants to ensure that the athletes' personal data remains secure. Which of the following measures can he use to balance user convenience and data security?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Use a combination of username and password for user authentication.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Use biometric identification like fingerprint or face recognition for user authentication.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Send the password in plaintext through email for every login attempt.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Bypass all kinds of user authentication to make it easier for athletes to use the app.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Biometric identification like fingerprint or face recognition provides a high level of security without requiring the user to remember and type in complex passwords, making it a good balance between convenience and security. Sending passwords via email in plaintext (option 3) is a serious security risk and bypassing user authentication (option 4) leaves the app and the data it collects unprotected.\"\n}"
