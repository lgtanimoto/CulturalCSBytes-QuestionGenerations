In the game, a user can choose an ethnic or racial group, and then the game provides information about the chosen group's history, important personalities, and cultural traditions. Sammy's variable and method names are all in shorthand, making the code difficult to understand. How should Sammy document their design decisions to make the program easier to understand for others?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Add comments in the code explaining what each shorthand denotes\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Create a separate document explaining the meaning of each shorthand\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Make a presentation explaining the different shorthands\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Rename all shorthands with longer, self-explanatory names\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Comments in the code are a useful way to document design decisions as they can describe exactly what a snippet of code does, why it does what it does, or why it doesn't do something else. This allows anyone who reads the code to understand its workings easily, even if they are not familiar with the shorthand names.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"class Game\\n    type any VarR = race\\n    action Info()\\n        if VarR == 'B'\\n            output \\\"Display Black Culture\\\"\\n        elif VarR == 'W'\\n            output \\\"Display White Culture\\\"\\n        else\\n            output \\\"Display Asian Culture\\\"\\n        end\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
