The first step is to create a procedure that identifies specific bias-indicating phrases in the text.

This suggests that 'a' represents the phrase to be found and 'b' is the comment text in which the phrase is to be searched for.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action findPhrase( text a, text b ) returns boolean\\n    if b:contains(a) then\\n        return true\\n    else\\n        return false\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
