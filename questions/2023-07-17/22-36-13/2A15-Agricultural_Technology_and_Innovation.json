However, their program has an error. Considering the code snippet below, what will be the output when GreenThumb calls `OutputWaterRequirements('Apples', 200)`?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"\\u00a0\\u00a010\\u00a0\\u00a0litres\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"\\u00a0\\u00a02000\\u00a0\\u00a0litres\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"\\u00a0\\u00a0400\\u00a0\\u00a0litres\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"\\u00a0\\u00a01000\\u00a0\\u00a0litres\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The program is meant to output the number of litres of water needed each day for a specific type and number of plants. Each apple tree needs 10 litres of water per day, so 200 apple trees would require 2000 litres of water. It seems there is a mistake in the computation of water requirement for 'Tomatoes', and it's doubling the need instead.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action OutputWaterRequirements(text plantType, integer numberPlants)\\n    if plantType = \\\"Apples\\\"\\n        output 10 * numberPlants\\n    elsif plantType = \\\"Tomatoes\\\"\\n        output 2 * numberPlants\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
