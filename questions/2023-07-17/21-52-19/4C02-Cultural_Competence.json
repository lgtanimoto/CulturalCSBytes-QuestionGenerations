As a first step, Eli is learning about the different layers of computer systems to better understand how the application will interact with the hardware and software. Which order corrects lists the layers from the highest level of abstraction to the lowest?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Application software, Operating system, Device drivers, Hardware\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Hardware, Device drivers, Operating system, Application software\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Application software, Hardware, Device drivers, Operating system\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Operating system, Application software, Device drivers, Hardware\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Application software, such as Eli's global cultural competence app, is the highest level of abstraction, used by end-users. The system software, the operating system, communicates between hardware and applications. The device drivers, part of system software, control the hardware. The hardware is the lowest level of abstraction.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"// Starting to build the global cultural competence application\\n\\n// Would include interacting with operating system and device drivers to deliver functionality\\nclass GlobalCultureApp\\n    action Start()\\n        //initialize resources, establish network connections, etc.\\n    end\\n\\n    action ConnectWithUser(string username)\\n        //Connect with other users of the application\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
