The application needs to interact with the barcode scanning system software to get the barcode, and then retrieve details of the art piece from a database. Which of the following best describes this interaction?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"The application software directly interacts with the hardware to scan the barcode.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"The system software fetches the information from the database, while the application software scans the barcode.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The system software communicates with the barcode scanner hardware and sends the barcode to the application software, which then fetches the art piece information from the database.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"The application software does all functions: scanning the barcode, interacting with the system software, and retrieving database information.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The system software acts as an intermediary, allowing the application software to interact with the hardware. In this case, the system software obtains the barcode from the scanner and passes it to the application software, which then uses the barcode to retrieve the necessary information from the database.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action getArtPieceInformation(integer barcode)\\n Access artPiece = new Access()\\n artPiece.connect()\\n string artPieceInfo = artPiece.fetchInfo(barcode)\\n output artPieceInfo\\nend\"\n}"
