They are using an API that returns holiday details in a JSON format. Recently, their friends from different countries reported that some of the holidays are missing in their list. Riley suspects that their function may wrongly ignore some of the holiday entries. What suggestion would you give to Riley to pinpoint the problem?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Suggest that Riley tags friends on social media asking about their holidays.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Recommend that Riley opens the application on their computer to identify the bug.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Suggest to Riley that they run the program line by line to identify where the error happens.\", \n    \"Answer4\": \"Ask Riley to clarify the problem through an open letter on a public platform.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"3\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Running the function that processes the API data line by line or step by step, also known as debugging, can help identify the point where the function starts misbehaving. This strategy helps in identifying the line of code or the condition leading to the omission of certain holidays.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"action ProcessHolidayData(text data)\\n    array<text> holidays = ParseJSON(data)\\n    for each holiday in holidays\\n        if holiday:Month <= GetCurrentMonth() and holiday:Day <= GetCurrentDay()\\n            output holiday:Name\\n        end\\n    end\\nend\"\n}"
