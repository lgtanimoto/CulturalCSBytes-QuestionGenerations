However, the program always displays holidays of all religions to all users, which creates a cluttered and confusing interface. How can Indigo improve the program?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Indigo could add a user preferences section where users can select their religion.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Indigo could remove all religious holidays from the program.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Indigo could make all holidays invisible in the program interface.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Indigo could force all users to celebrate all religious holidays.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Adding a user preferences section where users can select their religion would allow the software to display only the holidays relevant to that user. This would eliminate unnecessary information and make the interface cleaner and easier to read.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"class User\\n    text religion\\n    action SetReligion(text newReligion)\\n        religion = newReligion\\n    end\\nend\\n\\nUser u\\nu:SetReligion('Christian')\\n// TODO: Write code to filter holidays based on user's religion\"\n}"
