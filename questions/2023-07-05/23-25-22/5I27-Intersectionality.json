The goal is to approach equity in the education system. Rocket\u2019s application gets widespread attention, and she's invited to discuss the potential evolution of her application on a popular technology podcast. Which of the following would you expect her to say in predicting how her computational innovation might evolve?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"It could evolve into an educational resource, providing insights to policymakers and educators to address educational inequities more effectively.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"The scope of the application could remain fixed, focusing only on gender, race, and socioeconomic status in academic opportunities.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The application could get simpler over time, gradually phasing out machine learning altogether.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"The application could remain unchanged, as sophisticated machine learning models aren't expected to evolve or improve over time.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Computational innovations constantly evolve to address broadening concerns and meet new needs. Rocket\u2019s application, which already uses machine learning to explore intersectionality in academic opportunities, could broaden its scope, becoming an impactful tool for educational equity, informing decisions made by policymakers and educators.\"\n}"
