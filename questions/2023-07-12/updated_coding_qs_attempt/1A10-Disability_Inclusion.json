Bailey's program uses a list of inclusive games, and the program should output one game at a time, only when a user indicates they are ready to learn the next game. A part of Bailey's program looks as follows:Which of the following codes will replace the TODO section correctly?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Repeat with game from inclusiveGames\\noutput 'Next Game: ' + game\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Repeat with game from inclusiveGames\\n    output 'Are you ready for the next game?'\\n    if getUserBoolean() = true\\n        output 'Next game: ' + game\\n    end\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"For each game from inclusiveGames\\n    output 'Are you ready for the next game?'\\n    if getUserBoolean() = false\\n        output 'Next game: ' + game\\n    end\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Output 'Are you ready for the next game?'\\nif getUserBoolean() then\\n    output 'Next game: ' + game\\nend\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In Bailey's program a game is only output if the user is ready for it. This can be done using a loop to iterate over all the games and asking the user if they're ready before outputting each game. Therefore, option 2 is correct. In this code, for each game in inclusiveGames, the program will prompt the user with 'Are you ready for the next game?'. If the user inputs true, then the program will output the next game.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"list of text inclusiveGames = [\\\"Goalball\\\", \\\"Powerchair Football\\\", \\\"Boccia\\\", \\\"Wheelchair Basketball\\\", \\\"Adaptive Climbing\\\"]\\n\\n// TODO: Output a game when user is ready\\n\"\n}"
