They write code in Quorum to determine the number of positive interactions a person has with their peers. The code observes the interactions of a person with a list of classmates. When there is a positive interaction, the 'positiveInteraction' count increases by 1. What will the output be after interacting with 5 classmates having all positive interactions?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"The output will be 1.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"The output will be 5.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"The output will depend on the number of negative interactions.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"The output will be 0.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The code increments the 'positiveInteraction' count for every positive interaction, so after five positive interactions, the output will be 5.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"integer positiveInteraction = 0\\nrepeat 5 times\\n    text interaction = GetNextInteraction()\\n    if interaction == \\\"Positive\\\"\\n        positiveInteraction = positiveInteraction + 1\\n    end\\nend\\noutput \\\"Number of positive interactions: \\\" + positiveInteraction\"\n}"
