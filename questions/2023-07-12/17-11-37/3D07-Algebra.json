They have a piece of code written that solves for the values of x in a quadratic equation : ax2 + bx + c = 0. Val wants to represent the coefficient values a, b, and c in binary instead of decimal as a new challenge. Here's a piece of the program:Which of the following is the correct binary representation for the coefficients a = 5, b = -3, and c = 2?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"a: '101', b: ' -11', c: '10'\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"a: '110', b: ' -110', c: '100'\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"a: '100', b: ' -101', c: '11'\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"a: '101', b: ' -111', c: '10'\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In binary, 5 is represented as '101', -3 is represented as ' -11' and 2 is represented as '10'.
