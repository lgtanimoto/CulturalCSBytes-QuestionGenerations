They want to use data of different individual attributes and see how they intersect to affect the individual's life.

Other options would have issues in showing the intersections or the relative effectiveness of different attributes.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"class Person\\n action Person()\\n  Dictionary <text,text> attributes = undefined\\n end\\n action setAttribute(text key, text value)\\n  attributes:Add(key, value)\\n end\\n action outputAttributes()\\n  text output = \\\"\\\"\\n  repeat through each key, value in attributes\\n   output = output + key + \\\": \\\" + value + \\\"\\\\n\\\"\\n  end\\n  output output\\n end\\nend\"\n}"
