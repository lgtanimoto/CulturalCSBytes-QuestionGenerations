She wants to create a simple program that applies the theory of Circle of Fifths in music - a rule used to determine the key signature of a piece of music. Below is her initial program in Quorum. She's developing a method `FindKeySignature` which takes an integer as input (representing number of steps in the Circle of Fifths) and triggers an event to initiate instructions that print out the correct key signature. What can she add to her program to accomplish this?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Create an array of key signatures and use the input number as an index to access and output the correct key signature.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Create a long if-else structure to output the correct key signature based on the input number.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Use a loop to iterate over all the keys from C to B and output the correct key signature.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Create a switch statement to output the correct key signature based on the input number.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"1\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"In this scenario, creating an array would be the most straightforward solution. Each index in the array could be associated with a step in the Circle of Fifths, allowing Melody to easily find and output the appropriate key signature.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"use Libraries.Sound.Music\\naction FindKeySignature(integer steps)\\n    Music m\\n    number keySignature = m:GetKeySignature()\\n    if steps > 0\\n        // code to find keySignature based on the steps\\n    end\\n    if steps < 0\\n        // code to find keySignature based on the steps\\n    end\\n    output keySignature\\nend\"\n}",
