However, users have informed that sometimes, the reminders do not pop up at the pre-set times. Users are not sure of what might be the reason. Which systematic troubleshooting guideline should Zoro's team implement to debug this?\",\n    \"Answer1\": \"Make a habit of closing and re-opening the application.\",\n    \"Answer2\": \"Ensure that the device time settings matches with the timezone set in the application.\",\n    \"Answer3\": \"Try setting reminders for past dates and events.\",\n    \"Answer4\": \"Keep adding reminders and observe when it crashes.\",\n    \"CorrectAnswer\": \"2\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"Answer 2 provides a systematic troubleshooting strategy that allows to identify if the app's failure to pop up reminders has to do with a discrepancy between device time and the application's timezone. The other options are less systematic and may not lead to identifying the root cause.\",\n    \"code_snippet\": \"class Reminder\\n\\n   action createReminder(integer hour, integer minute, string message)\\n      if (hour < 0 || hour > 23 || minute < 0 || minute > 59)\\n           output \\\"Invalid Time\\\"\\n           return\\n      end\\n      //code to create reminders...\\n   end\\n\\n   action popUpReminder(integer currentHour, integer currentMinute, string message)\\n      //code to pop up reminders...\\n   end\\n\\nend\"\n}",
