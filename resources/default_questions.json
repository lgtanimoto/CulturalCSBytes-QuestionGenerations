However, soon after the article was published, <span class=\"qname\">Kauai</span> received several negative comments from both students and teachers about both the methodology and conclusions of the poll.  <span class=\"qname\">Kauai</span>'s high school is an urban, multi-ethnic, 9-12 public high school with about 1,600 students</p><p>Which of the following reasons is <em>LEAST LIKELY</em> to be included in the negative comments from <em>TEACHERS</em> about the poll and the article?</p>",

The students polled are likely to reflect the students in <span class=\"qname\">Kauai</span>'s advanced coding class \ufffd not the entire school.
